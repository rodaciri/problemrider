Go through each problem and focus on the **Category** entry. Read the title and its short description, then reorder the positions within the category list based on which category the title fits best. Remove any categories that don’t make sense, and add missing ones if needed; retain existing ones if they seem appropriate. Don’t get too detailed with category names—keep them simple and practical.
