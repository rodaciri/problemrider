## Description

ABI (Application Binary Interface) compatibility issues arise when applications compiled against one version of a library or system component are used with a different version that has incompatible binary interfaces. This can cause crashes, memory corruption, incorrect behavior, or failure to load, as the application expects different function signatures, data layouts, or calling conventions than what the runtime library provides.

## Indicators ⟡

- Applications crash immediately upon startup or when calling specific library functions
- Functions return unexpected values or behave differently than expected
- Memory corruption or segmentation faults occur in library interaction code
- Dynamic linking fails with symbol resolution errors
- Applications work in development but fail in production with different library versions

## Symptoms ▲
- [Regulatory Compliance Drift](regulatory-compliance-drift.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.354, Strength: 0.629">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  In legacy systems, ABI compatibility issues can lead to outdated libraries that fail to support new regulatory requirements, resulting in compliance gaps that signal deeper technical deficiencies in the software architecture.
- [Analysis Paralysis](analysis-paralysis.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.351, Strength: 0.762">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Teams facing compatibility issues often become overwhelmed by the need to thoroughly investigate and validate the correct library versions and dependencies, leading to prolonged analysis phases that hinder progress on actual implementation.

## Root Causes ▼
- [Shared Dependencies](shared-dependencies.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.411, Strength: 0.949">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The presence of shared libraries across multiple components in legacy systems often leads to ABI compatibility issues when updates are made, as differing versions of a library can introduce changes that break the expected binary interface, ultimately resulting in runtime failures or undefined behavior.
- [Breaking Changes](breaking-changes.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.348, Strength: 0.812">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Updates that introduce breaking changes to APIs often alter the underlying data structures or calling conventions, resulting in application binary interface incompatibilities that lead to runtime failures in legacy systems relying on previous versions.
- [Increasing Brittleness](increasing-brittleness.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.325, Strength: 0.825">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  As software systems evolve, accumulated complexity and interdependencies lead to fragile architectures where minor updates can disrupt the delicate balance of ABI, resulting in compatibility issues that manifest as runtime failures or unpredictable behavior.

## Detection Methods ○

- **Binary Analysis Tools:** Use tools to compare ABI compatibility between library versions
- **Symbol Verification:** Check that expected symbols exist and have correct signatures
- **Runtime Testing:** Test applications with different library versions to identify incompatibilities
- **Linking Analysis:** Analyze linking behavior and symbol resolution during application startup
- **Memory Layout Verification:** Verify data structure layouts match between compile and runtime versions
- **Compatibility Testing Suites:** Use automated testing to verify ABI compatibility across versions

## Examples

An application compiled against version 1.0 of a graphics library expects a Color struct with three integer fields (RGB), but version 2.0 changed the struct to four fields (RGBA). When the application runs with the new library, it corrupts memory by writing past the expected struct boundary, causing crashes and unpredictable behavior. Another example involves a networking library that changed a function signature from `send_data(char* data, int length)` to `send_data(const char* data, size_t length)` between versions. Applications compiled against the old version pass incorrect parameter types, leading to data corruption or crashes when the size parameter is interpreted incorrectly.
