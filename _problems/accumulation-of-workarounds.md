## Description

Accumulation of workarounds occurs when developers consistently choose temporary fixes and elaborate bypasses instead of addressing underlying problems directly. These workarounds are often created under time pressure or when the root cause seems too risky or complex to fix properly. Over time, these workarounds layer upon each other, creating a complex web of dependencies and alternative logic paths that make the system increasingly difficult to understand and maintain.

## Indicators ⟡

- Multiple code paths exist to accomplish the same basic functionality
- Documentation or comments frequently mention "temporary fix" or "workaround for issue X"
- New features require understanding and navigating around existing workarounds
- Developers express confusion about why certain code patterns exist
- Simple changes require modifications in multiple, seemingly unrelated places

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○

- **Code Review Analysis:** Look for patterns of alternative logic paths and conditional workarounds
- **Code Comments Audit:** Search for comments containing "workaround," "hack," "temporary," or "TODO"
- **Complexity Metrics:** Monitor cyclomatic complexity increases that aren't tied to business logic growth
- **Developer Interviews:** Ask team members about code areas they find confusing or overly complex
- **Change Impact Analysis:** Track how many files need modification for simple changes

## Examples

A payment processing system has three different code paths for calculating shipping costs because previous attempts to fix bugs in the original calculation led to workarounds for specific customer types. New developers must understand all three paths to modify shipping logic, and each path has its own set of edge cases and exceptions. Another example involves an inventory management system where a memory leak in the original stock tracking algorithm was "fixed" by adding a daily restart routine, a cache clearing function that runs every hour, and a separate background process that reconciles discrepancies. These workarounds mask the underlying problem while adding operational complexity and potential failure points.
