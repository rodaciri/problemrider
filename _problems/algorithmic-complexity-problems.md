## Description

Algorithmic complexity problems occur when code uses algorithms or data structures with poor time or space complexity for the given use case, resulting in unnecessary performance bottlenecks and resource consumption. These problems often manifest as operations that perform acceptably with small data sets but become prohibitively slow as data volume grows. Poor algorithmic choices can make systems unusable at scale and waste significant computational resources.


## Indicators ⟡
- Operations that work fine in development become slow with production-sized data
- Performance degrades dramatically as data volume increases
- Simple operations consume excessive CPU time or memory
- Database queries return reasonable amounts of data but processing takes excessive time
- Users report that certain features become unusably slow over time

## Detection Methods ○
- **Performance Profiling:** Use profiling tools to identify methods that consume disproportionate CPU time
- **Complexity Analysis:** Review code to identify algorithms with poor Big O complexity characteristics
- **Load Testing:** Test with production-sized data to reveal algorithmic scalability issues
- **Resource Monitoring:** Track CPU, memory, and I/O usage to identify inefficient operations
- **Benchmark Comparisons:** Compare current algorithm performance against more efficient alternatives


## Examples

An e-commerce application needs to find the top 10 most popular products from a catalog of 100,000 items. The developer implements this by loading all products into memory, then using a nested loop to count purchases for each product, resulting in O(n²) complexity. With small test data sets, the operation completes in milliseconds, but with production data, it takes 45 seconds and consumes 8GB of memory. A simple change to use a hash map for counting and a priority queue for finding the top results would reduce this to O(n log k) complexity, completing in under 100 milliseconds. Another example involves a social media application that displays a user's news feed by iterating through all of their friends' posts (potentially thousands) and sorting them by timestamp using a bubble sort algorithm. As users accumulate more friends and posts, the feed loading time grows quadratically. Users with many friends experience feed load times of 30+ seconds, making the application unusable. Switching to an efficient sorting algorithm and implementing pagination would solve the performance problem while improving user experience.
