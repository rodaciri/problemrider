## Description

Analysis paralysis occurs when development teams become trapped in endless research, analysis, and planning phases without transitioning to actual implementation work. The team continues gathering information, evaluating options, and refining their understanding but never feels confident enough to begin building solutions. This paralysis often stems from perfectionist tendencies, fear of making wrong decisions, or lack of clear criteria for when analysis is sufficient to proceed with implementation.


## Indicators ⟡

- Research phases consistently exceed their planned duration
- Teams repeatedly postpone implementation to gather more information
- Multiple competing technical approaches are analyzed without selecting one
- Analysis documents and proof-of-concepts accumulate without leading to production code
- Team expresses uncertainty about when they have "enough" information to proceed

## Detection Methods ○

- **Research Duration Tracking:** Monitor how long teams spend in analysis phases vs. planned timelines
- **Decision Log Analysis:** Track how many decisions are deferred pending additional analysis
- **Implementation Start Date Tracking:** Measure delays between planned and actual implementation start
- **Analysis Output Review:** Evaluate whether analysis documents lead to actionable implementation plans
- **Team Velocity Metrics:** Monitor whether research phases correlate with reduced development velocity


## Examples

A development team spends four months analyzing different microservices architectures, evaluating twelve different technologies, creating detailed comparison matrices, and building multiple proof-of-concept applications. Despite having enough information to make an informed decision after the first month, they continue analyzing "just to be sure" and exploring edge cases that may never occur in practice. Meanwhile, the project deadline approaches and no production code has been written. Another example involves a team researching database migration strategies for six weeks, creating elaborate test plans and performance benchmarks, but never actually beginning the migration because they want to be absolutely certain they've considered every possible optimization and risk mitigation strategy.
