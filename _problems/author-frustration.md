## Description

Author frustration occurs when developers become increasingly frustrated with the code review process due to receiving unpredictable, conflicting, or seemingly arbitrary feedback on their code submissions. This frustration stems from inconsistent review standards, lengthy back-and-forth discussions on subjective preferences, or feeling that reviewers focus on trivial issues while missing important aspects of the code.


## Indicators ⟡

- Developers express annoyance or resistance during code review discussions
- Authors frequently challenge or argue with review feedback
- Code review cycles involve multiple rounds of conflicting suggestions
- Developers start writing defensive comments or over-explaining their code
- Team members begin to avoid submitting code for review when possible

## Detection Methods ○

- **Author Satisfaction Surveys:** Collect feedback about the review experience from code authors
- **Review Cycle Analysis:** Track how many rounds of review are needed and why revisions are requested
- **Comment Type Classification:** Analyze what types of issues generate the most back-and-forth discussion
- **Team Relationship Assessment:** Monitor signs of tension or conflict arising from review processes
- **Code Submission Patterns:** Look for changes in how frequently developers submit code for review


## Examples

A developer submits a well-tested feature implementation and receives feedback from three different reviewers: one wants the code refactored into smaller functions, another suggests combining functions for efficiency, and the third focuses entirely on variable naming conventions. After addressing the first reviewer's feedback, the second reviewer objects to the changes, and the third reviewer adds new style requirements. The author spends more time addressing review feedback than writing the original feature and becomes frustrated with the seemingly arbitrary and conflicting demands. Another example involves a developer whose pull requests consistently receive dozens of minor style comments about spacing, naming, and formatting, while logical errors or design issues go unnoticed. The author begins adding excessive comments and documentation to preempt criticism, making the code unnecessarily verbose and slowing down development.
