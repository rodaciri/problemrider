## Description

Authorization flaws occur when access control mechanisms fail to properly restrict user actions and resource access according to their intended permissions. These vulnerabilities allow users to perform unauthorized operations, access restricted data, or escalate their privileges beyond what should be permitted, potentially compromising system security and data integrity.


## Indicators ⟡

- Users can access resources or perform actions outside their assigned roles
- Horizontal privilege escalation allows access to other users' data
- Vertical privilege escalation allows users to gain administrative privileges
- Access control decisions made on client-side rather than server-side
- Inconsistent permission enforcement across different system components


## Symptoms ▲

- [Flaky Tests](flaky-tests.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.393, Strength: 0.727">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Inadequate access control mechanisms can lead to inconsistent test outcomes, as unauthorized actions may inadvertently pass or fail tests due to unpredictable user permissions, highlighting underlying flaws in the system.

## Root Causes ▼

- [Poor Encapsulation](poor-encapsulation.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.322, Strength: 0.915">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of data encapsulation allows unauthorized access to sensitive information and functionality, as it fails to properly restrict user interactions with the system's internal components, thereby enabling actions outside of intended permissions.

## Detection Methods ○

- **Access Control Testing:** Test all protected resources and functions for proper authorization
- **Privilege Escalation Testing:** Attempt to escalate privileges through various attack vectors
- **Role-Based Access Testing:** Verify that role assignments properly restrict access
- **Direct Object Reference Testing:** Test manipulation of object identifiers to access unauthorized resources
- **Function-Level Authorization Review:** Review all administrative and sensitive functions for proper access control


## Examples

A project management application allows users to view project details by accessing URLs like `/project/123`. Users discover they can change the project ID to access any project in the system, including confidential projects they shouldn't see. The application authenticates users but fails to verify that they have permission to access the specific project requested, allowing anyone to view any project data. Another example involves a content management system where regular users can access administrative functions by directly navigating to admin URLs. While the UI hides admin menu items from regular users, the server-side doesn't check user roles before executing administrative operations, allowing privilege escalation through direct URL manipulation.
