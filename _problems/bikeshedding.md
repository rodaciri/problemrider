## Description
Bikeshedding, also known as Parkinson's law of triviality, is a phenomenon where a disproportionate amount of time and energy is spent on trivial and insignificant details, while more important and complex issues are neglected. This often occurs in meetings where participants avoid challenging topics and instead focus on easy-to-understand but ultimately unimportant details. Bikeshedding is a major time-waster, and it can be a sign of a dysfunctional team culture.

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○

- **Code Review Metrics:** Analyze the types of comments made in pull requests (e.g., ratio of stylistic comments to logical/design comments).
- **Developer Surveys:** Ask developers about their perception of code review effectiveness and common feedback types.
- **Retrospectives:** Discuss code review processes and identify recurring frustrations or inefficiencies.
- **Reviewer Training:** Observe if training on effective code review practices improves the quality of feedback.


## Examples

- **Scenario:** A developer submits a pull request that introduces a new, complex algorithm. The review discussion spans days, with 80% of the comments debating whether to use single or double quotes for strings, while a critical edge case in the algorithm goes unnoticed.
- **Specific Instance:** A team implements a new feature, and during the code review, a senior developer spends an hour debating the naming convention for a private helper function, even though the project has a linter that could enforce such rules automatically.
- **Context:** This problem often arises when teams lack clear processes, automated tooling, or sufficient training for code reviews. It can significantly hinder development velocity and prevent the team from focusing on what truly matters for code quality and project success.
