## Description

Breaking changes occur when modifications to APIs, interfaces, or system behaviors cause existing client integrations to fail or behave incorrectly. These changes violate backward compatibility expectations and force clients to update their code, often unexpectedly and on short notice. Breaking changes can severely damage relationships with integration partners, cause production outages, and create emergency support situations.


## Indicators ⟡

- Client applications stop working after API updates
- Integration partners report sudden failures in their systems
- Support tickets spike immediately following API releases
- Client developers express frustration about unexpected changes
- Emergency rollbacks are needed to restore client functionality

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○

- **Integration Test Monitoring:** Automated tests that verify API compatibility with existing client patterns
- **Client Usage Analytics:** Monitor how different API endpoints and parameters are actually used
- **Version Compatibility Testing:** Test new API versions against existing client code and integration patterns
- **Client Feedback Channels:** Establish communication channels for clients to report compatibility issues
- **Change Impact Assessment:** Systematic evaluation of how proposed changes affect existing integrations
- **Breaking Change Alerts:** Automated detection of changes that could break existing client code


## Examples

An e-commerce API changes the data structure of product information responses, moving the price field from a simple number to a complex object with currency and tax information. Hundreds of client applications that parse the price field directly break immediately, causing shopping cart failures and order processing issues across multiple retail websites. The API provider must maintain both old and new response formats while clients scramble to update their code. Another example involves a payment processing API that changes authentication requirements without sufficient notice, causing all client transactions to fail during peak shopping hours, resulting in millions of dollars in lost sales and emergency support calls.
