## Description
Budget overruns are a common problem in software development. They occur when the project costs more than originally planned. This can happen for a number of reasons, such as scope creep, poor estimation, or unforeseen circumstances. Budget overruns can lead to a number of problems, including a loss of funding for the project, a great deal of frustration for the stakeholders, and a decline in team morale. Budget overruns are often a sign of a poorly managed project.

## Indicators ⟡
- The project is constantly asking for more money.
- The project is not delivering the expected value for the money.
- The stakeholders are not happy with the cost of the project.
- The project is at risk of being canceled.

## Symptoms ▲
- **[Increased Cost of Development](increased-cost-of-development.md):** The cost of developing and maintaining the system is inflated due to the extra work being done.
- **[Declining Business Metrics](declining-business-metrics.md):** The project may lose its funding if it goes over budget.
- **[Negative User Feedback](negative-user-feedback.md):** The stakeholders may become frustrated with the project if it is not delivering the expected value for the money.
- **[Developer Frustration and Burnout](developer-frustration-and-burnout.md):** The constant pressure to cut costs can have a negative impact on team morale.

## Root Causes ▼
- **[Scope Creep](scope-creep.md):** The project's scope is constantly expanding, which is driving up the cost of the project.
- **[Planning Dysfunction](planning-dysfunction.md):** The team is not good at estimating how much it will cost to complete tasks.
- **Unforeseen Circumstances:** The team may encounter unforeseen circumstances that drive up the cost of the project.
- **Lack of a Clear Budget:** The project may not have a clear budget, which makes it difficult to track costs.
- **[Change Management Chaos](change-management-chaos.md):** There is no process for evaluating the cost of new requests.

## Detection Methods ○
- **Track Project Costs:** Keep a log of all project costs and see how they are tracking against the budget.
- **Earned Value Management:** Use earned value management to track the project's progress against the budget.
- **Compare Plan vs. Actuals:** Regularly compare the project's costs against the original plan to see how much the scope has changed.
- **Stakeholder Feedback:** If stakeholders are constantly asking "How much is this going to cost?", it may be a sign that they are not happy with the cost of the project.

## Examples
A team is building a new mobile app. The project has a budget of $100,000. However, the scope of the project is constantly expanding. The team is constantly being asked to add new features to the app. As a result, the project goes over budget. The project eventually costs $200,000 to complete. The stakeholders are not happy, and the project is at risk of being canceled.
