## Description
Budget overruns are a common problem in software development. They occur when the project costs more than originally planned. This can happen for a number of reasons, such as scope creep, poor estimation, or unforeseen circumstances. Budget overruns can lead to a number of problems, including a loss of funding for the project, a great deal of frustration for the stakeholders, and a decline in team morale. Budget overruns are often a sign of a poorly managed project.

## Indicators ⟡
- The project is constantly asking for more money.
- The project is not delivering the expected value for the money.
- The stakeholders are not happy with the cost of the project.
- The project is at risk of being canceled.

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○
- **Track Project Costs:** Keep a log of all project costs and see how they are tracking against the budget.
- **Earned Value Management:** Use earned value management to track the project's progress against the budget.
- **Compare Plan vs. Actuals:** Regularly compare the project's costs against the original plan to see how much the scope has changed.
- **Stakeholder Feedback:** If stakeholders are constantly asking "How much is this going to cost?", it may be a sign that they are not happy with the cost of the project.

## Examples
A team is building a new mobile app. The project has a budget of $100,000. However, the scope of the project is constantly expanding. The team is constantly being asked to add new features to the app. As a result, the project goes over budget. The project eventually costs $200,000 to complete. The stakeholders are not happy, and the project is at risk of being canceled.
