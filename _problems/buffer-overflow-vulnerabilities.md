## Description

Buffer overflow vulnerabilities occur when a program writes more data to a buffer than it can hold, causing the excess data to overwrite adjacent memory locations. This can corrupt data, crash the application, or be exploited by attackers to execute malicious code. Buffer overflows are particularly dangerous because they can be used to compromise system security by overwriting return addresses, function pointers, or other critical program data.


## Indicators ⟡

- Application crashes with segmentation faults or access violations
- Memory corruption symptoms such as unexpected variable values
- Security scanning tools report potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities
- Crashes occur when processing specific input patterns or sizes
- Stack traces show corruption or unexpected function call sequences


## Symptoms ▲

- [Unreleased Resources](unreleased-resources.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.481, Strength: 0.770">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  When data is written beyond allocated memory boundaries, it can corrupt the management of system resources, leading to objects or connections remaining allocated without proper deallocation, which serves as an indicator of underlying memory handling issues.
- [Logging Configuration Issues](logging-configuration-issues.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.418, Strength: 0.884">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Improper logging configuration can obscure the detection of buffer overflow vulnerabilities by failing to capture critical error messages or anomalous behavior that indicate memory corruption, thus making it difficult to identify and remediate security risks in legacy systems.
- [Memory Leaks](memory-leaks.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.414, Strength: 0.894">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  When programs experience memory writes beyond allocated boundaries, it can lead to corruption of memory management structures, which in turn causes failure to release memory, resulting in gradual resource exhaustion and performance issues.
- [Delayed Bug Fixes](delayed-bug-fixes.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.356, Strength: 0.823">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The unresolved security vulnerabilities caused by improper memory management often lead to an accumulation of known issues, as legacy systems struggle to prioritize and implement fixes for complex, foundational problems, resulting in prolonged user frustration.
- [Unbounded Data Growth](unbounded-data-growth.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.335, Strength: 0.808">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Unbounded data growth often indicates buffer overflow vulnerabilities in legacy systems, as unchecked data accumulation can lead to memory being overwritten or corrupted, exposing the system to security risks and instability.

## Detection Methods ○

- **Static Analysis Tools:** Use tools that can identify potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities in source code
- **Dynamic Analysis:** Runtime tools like AddressSanitizer that detect buffer overflows during execution
- **Fuzzing:** Automated testing with random or malformed inputs to trigger buffer overflow conditions
- **Code Review:** Manual review focusing on memory management and bounds checking
- **Penetration Testing:** Security testing specifically targeting buffer overflow exploitation
- **Memory Protection Tools:** Use tools like Valgrind to detect memory errors during development


## Examples

A C program uses the strcpy function to copy user input into a fixed-size character array without checking the input length. When a user provides input longer than the buffer size, strcpy overwrites adjacent stack memory, potentially corrupting local variables or the function return address. An attacker can exploit this by crafting input that overwrites the return address with the address of malicious code, effectively hijacking program execution. Another example involves a network service that reads packet data into a fixed buffer without validating the packet size field. Malicious packets with incorrect size information can cause the service to write beyond buffer boundaries, potentially allowing remote code execution or causing service crashes that enable denial-of-service attacks.
