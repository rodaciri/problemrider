## Description

Cascade failures occur when a single change, bug, or failure in one component causes a domino effect of failures throughout interconnected system components. These failures spread rapidly through the system because components are tightly coupled or share critical resources, making it difficult to contain problems to their source. Cascade failures are particularly dangerous because they can transform minor issues into system-wide outages and make recovery extremely difficult.

## Indicators ⟡
- Single component failures result in multiple system areas becoming unavailable
- Small changes frequently cause widespread test failures
- System outages affect seemingly unrelated functionality
- Recovery from failures requires restarting multiple components or the entire system
- Error messages from one component trigger errors in many other components

## Symptoms ▲

<br/>  Misconfigured or ineffective rate limiting can exacerbate cascade failures by blocking legitimate requests, leading to compounded errors across interconnected components, thereby indicating underlying systemic instability.
- [Monolithic Architecture Constraints](monolithic-architecture-constraints.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.370, Strength: 0.807">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The difficulty in maintaining, scaling, and deploying large monolithic codebases increases the likelihood of unintended interdependencies, which can lead to a single change triggering widespread failures across multiple system components.
- [Insufficient Audit Logging](insufficient-audit-logging.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.367, Strength: 0.804">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The failure of a single component can lead to cascading issues that disrupt the logging mechanisms, resulting in insufficient visibility into security events and making it challenging to identify and address the root causes of system breakdowns.
- [Inadequate Configuration Management](inadequate-configuration-management.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.367, Strength: 0.818">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Poorly tracked code, data, or infrastructure versions can lead to unintentional changes that propagate through interconnected components, making it difficult to identify the original trigger of failures and exacerbating the cascading impact across the system.
- [Knowledge Silos](knowledge-silos.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.363, Strength: 0.725">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Isolated expertise within teams limits the dissemination of critical system knowledge, increasing the likelihood that unanticipated changes will lead to widespread failures as team members lack a holistic understanding of interdependencies within the legacy system.
- [Reduced Team Productivity](reduced-team-productivity.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.352, Strength: 0.841">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The chain reaction of failures resulting from a single change disrupts workflows and creates bottlenecks, leading to inefficiencies and a decline in the development team's output and effectiveness.

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○
- **Dependency Mapping:** Visualize component dependencies to identify potential cascade paths
- **Failure Simulation:** Chaos engineering approaches that deliberately fail components to test cascade behavior
- **Monitoring Correlation:** Track how often failures in one component coincide with failures in others
- **Recovery Time Analysis:** Measure how long different types of failures take to recover from
- **Error Pattern Analysis:** Identify patterns where single root causes generate multiple error types

## Examples

An e-commerce system has a shared user authentication service that all other components depend on. When a database connection pool in the authentication service becomes exhausted, it stops responding to requests. This causes the product catalog service to fail because it can't verify user permissions, the shopping cart service fails because it can't identify users, the payment service times out waiting for user verification, and the recommendation engine crashes because it can't access user preferences. What started as a simple connection pool configuration issue has taken down the entire platform. Recovery requires not only fixing the authentication service but also restarting all the other services that crashed while trying to reach it. Another example involves a data processing pipeline where each stage passes results to the next stage synchronously. When the third stage encounters a corrupted data record and crashes, it causes the second stage to time out waiting for a response, which causes the first stage to exhaust memory with queued items, ultimately requiring the entire pipeline to be restarted and all in-flight data to be reprocessed.
