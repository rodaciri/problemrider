## Description

Changing project scope occurs when project requirements, goals, or deliverables are frequently modified during development, often without proper assessment of the impact on timeline, resources, or team morale. This creates uncertainty about what the team is building, disrupts established development momentum, and forces constant re-planning and rework. Teams lose focus and struggle to make meaningful progress when direction changes frequently.


## Indicators ⟡

- Project requirements change multiple times within short periods
- Team members express confusion about current priorities and objectives
- Previously completed work is discarded or significantly modified due to scope changes
- Stakeholders provide conflicting or evolving requirements
- Development estimates become unreliable due to shifting targets


## Symptoms ▲

- [Reduced Team Productivity](reduced-team-productivity.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.470, Strength: 0.777">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Frequent shifts in project direction lead to confusion and rework among team members, resulting in diminished productivity as they struggle to adapt to changing requirements and prioritize tasks effectively.
- [Product Direction Chaos](product-direction-chaos.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.461, Strength: 0.777">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Frequent shifts in project direction stem from conflicting priorities among stakeholders, leading to confusion and misaligned efforts that hinder the team's ability to maintain a consistent focus on legacy system objectives.
- [Slow Development Velocity](slow-development-velocity.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.404, Strength: 0.754">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Frequent shifts in project direction lead to unclear priorities and constant rework, which disrupt the team's workflow and hinder their ability to maintain a consistent pace in delivering features and bug fixes.
- [Unclear Goals and Priorities](unclear-goals-and-priorities.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.392, Strength: 0.873">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Frequent changes in project direction create confusion around objectives, resulting in shifting priorities and a lack of clarity, which manifests as diminished motivation and productivity among team members in legacy systems.
- [Frequent Changes to Requirements](frequent-changes-to-requirements.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.386, Strength: 0.601">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Constantly updated requirements signal an unstable project direction, as they reflect the team's struggle to align on a cohesive vision, resulting in confusion, rework, and impeded progress in legacy systems.
- [Analysis Paralysis](analysis-paralysis.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.323, Strength: 0.722">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Frequent shifts in project direction lead to teams becoming overwhelmed by the need to reassess requirements and conduct additional research, which hinders their ability to move forward with implementation and results in stagnation in development efforts.

## Root Causes ▼

- [Gold Plating](gold-plating.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.369, Strength: 0.888">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The tendency to introduce unnecessary features leads to shifts in project direction as developers prioritize unrequested enhancements over established requirements, causing confusion and hindering progress in legacy systems.
- [High Technical Debt](high-technical-debt.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.365, Strength: 0.843">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The accumulation of design and implementation shortcuts leads to an unstable codebase, making it difficult for the team to adapt to new requirements without introducing further complications, thereby resulting in frequent changes to the project direction.
- [Eager to Please Stakeholders](eager-to-please-stakeholders.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.363, Strength: 0.863">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The project team's tendency to accommodate every stakeholder request without assessing the implications leads to continuous adjustments in project direction, ultimately resulting in confusion and hindering overall progress.
- [Large Estimates for Small Changes](large-estimates-for-small-changes.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.348, Strength: 0.819">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The team's tendency to provide large time estimates for small changes reflects the underlying complexity and fragility of the legacy codebase, leading to uncertainty and frequent changes in project scope as stakeholders respond to perceived risks and delays.
- [Maintenance Cost Increase](maintenance-cost-increase.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.310, Strength: 0.674">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The escalating resources needed for maintaining and updating legacy systems divert attention and budget from planned project objectives, leading to frequent shifts in project direction and confusion among the team.

## Detection Methods ○

- **Change Request Frequency Analysis:** Track how often and how significantly requirements change
- **Team Velocity Impact Assessment:** Measure productivity drops following scope changes
- **Stakeholder Alignment Surveys:** Assess whether different stakeholders have consistent understanding of goals
- **Requirements Traceability Analysis:** Map how requirements evolve over time
- **Team Morale Monitoring:** Regular check-ins on team satisfaction and clarity


## Examples

A mobile application development project begins with the goal of creating a simple expense tracking app. Two weeks into development, stakeholders decide they also want receipt scanning functionality. A month later, they want to add budgeting features and integration with multiple banks. Each change requires significant architectural modifications, and previously completed work on the simple expense entry becomes obsolete. The development team spends more time modifying existing features than building new ones, and the original three-month timeline stretches to eight months. Another example involves an e-commerce website where the business requirements change weekly based on competitor analysis - first requiring a certain checkout flow, then completely different payment options, then entirely new product categorization. Developers complete features only to have them redesigned before they can be deployed, leading to frustration and decreased confidence in project leadership.
