## Description

Changing project scope occurs when project requirements, goals, or deliverables are frequently modified during development, often without proper assessment of the impact on timeline, resources, or team morale. This creates uncertainty about what the team is building, disrupts established development momentum, and forces constant re-planning and rework. Teams lose focus and struggle to make meaningful progress when direction changes frequently.

## Indicators ⟡

- Project requirements change multiple times within short periods
- Team members express confusion about current priorities and objectives
- Previously completed work is discarded or significantly modified due to scope changes
- Stakeholders provide conflicting or evolving requirements
- Development estimates become unreliable due to shifting targets

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Delayed Project Timelines](delayed-project-timelines.md):** Constant scope changes push back delivery dates
- **[Developer Frustration and Burnout](developer-frustration-and-burnout.md):** Team becomes demoralized by constantly changing requirements
- **[Implementation Rework](implementation-rework.md):** Previously completed features must be modified or replaced
- **[Reduced Team Productivity](reduced-team-productivity.md):** Time is wasted on abandoned or modified work
- **[Wasted Development Effort](wasted-development-effort.md):** Significant work is abandoned or reworked due to scope changes
- **[Team Confusion](team-confusion.md):** Frequent changes create uncertainty about current project direction
- **[Planning Credibility Issues](planning-credibility-issues.md):** Estimates and plans lose credibility due to frequent changes

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Unclear Goals and Priorities](unclear-goals-and-priorities.md):** Initial project vision was not well-defined or communicated
- **[Stakeholder-Developer Communication Gap](stakeholder-developer-communication-gap.md):** Disconnect between business needs and development team understanding
- **[Market Pressure](market-pressure.md):** External competitive pressure forces rapid pivots
- **[Inadequate Requirements Gathering](inadequate-requirements-gathering.md):** Insufficient upfront analysis leads to later corrections
- **Weak Project Governance:** Change Management Chaos to evaluate scope modifications

## Detection Methods ○

- **Change Request Frequency Analysis:** Track how often and how significantly requirements change
- **Team Velocity Impact Assessment:** Measure productivity drops following scope changes
- **Stakeholder Alignment Surveys:** Assess whether different stakeholders have consistent understanding of goals
- **Requirements Traceability Analysis:** Map how requirements evolve over time
- **Team Morale Monitoring:** Regular check-ins on team satisfaction and clarity

## Examples

A mobile application development project begins with the goal of creating a simple expense tracking app. Two weeks into development, stakeholders decide they also want receipt scanning functionality. A month later, they want to add budgeting features and integration with multiple banks. Each change requires significant architectural modifications, and previously completed work on the simple expense entry becomes obsolete. The development team spends more time modifying existing features than building new ones, and the original three-month timeline stretches to eight months. Another example involves an e-commerce website where the business requirements change weekly based on competitor analysis - first requiring a certain checkout flow, then completely different payment options, then entirely new product categorization. Developers complete features only to have them redesigned before they can be deployed, leading to frustration and decreased confidence in project leadership.
