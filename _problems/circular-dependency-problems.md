## Description

Circular dependency problems occur when components depend on each other in circular patterns, where component A depends on component B, which depends on component C, which depends back on component A. These circular references create issues with initialization order, testing, compilation, and make the system architecture more complex and fragile.

## Indicators ⟡

- Build systems report circular dependency errors
- Components cannot be initialized or loaded independently
- Unit testing requires complex setup to break circular references
- Dependency injection frameworks fail to resolve circular dependencies
- Module loading systems encounter circular reference errors

## Symptoms ▲
- [Upstream Timeouts](upstream-timeouts.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.566, Strength: 0.760">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Circular dependencies can lead to delays in service initialization and processing, causing downstream services to exceed their timeout settings when waiting for responses, thereby indicating the underlying issue with inter-component dependencies.
- [Flaky Tests](flaky-tests.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.465, Strength: 0.754">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Circular dependencies create unpredictable initialization sequences that lead to inconsistent test environments, causing tests to fail intermittently and eroding confidence in their reliability.
- [Regulatory Compliance Drift](regulatory-compliance-drift.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.460, Strength: 0.656">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Circular dependencies complicate the architecture of legacy systems, making it difficult to implement timely updates or modifications necessary for compliance with evolving regulatory requirements, thus revealing compliance drift as a direct consequence of these intertwined dependencies.
- [Poor Test Coverage](poor-test-coverage.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.452, Strength: 0.668">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Circular dependencies complicate the initialization and execution flow of components, leading to critical code paths being untested and resulting in poor test coverage as developers struggle to reliably set up test scenarios.
- [Complex Domain Model](complex-domain-model.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.437, Strength: 0.676">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Circular dependencies complicate the design and implementation of the domain model, leading to convoluted relationships and interactions that obscure the business logic, ultimately manifesting as a complex and challenging system to navigate and understand.
- [Inconsistent Naming Conventions](inconsistent-naming-conventions.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.420, Strength: 0.698">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The presence of circular dependencies often leads to a chaotic code structure where naming conventions become inconsistent, as developers struggle to navigate intertwined components, resulting in unclear and conflicting identifiers that hinder maintainability.
- [Unreleased Resources](unreleased-resources.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.315, Strength: 0.564">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Circular dependencies hinder the proper lifecycle management of components, leading to situations where resources are not released because the dependent objects cannot be initialized or finalized correctly, resulting in unreleased resources.

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○

- **Static Dependency Analysis:** Use tools to detect circular dependencies in codebase
- **Build Error Monitoring:** Monitor build processes for circular dependency errors
- **Dependency Graph Visualization:** Create visual representations of component dependencies
- **Initialization Flow Analysis:** Analyze component initialization order and dependencies
- **Module Import Analysis:** Review import/require statements for circular patterns

## Examples

A web application has a `UserService` that depends on `OrderService` to get user order history, while `OrderService` depends on `UserService` to validate user permissions. Both services are initialized at startup, but neither can be instantiated because each requires the other to be created first. The dependency injection container fails with a circular dependency error. The circular dependency makes it impossible to unit test either service independently because testing `UserService` requires `OrderService`, which requires `UserService` to be initialized. Another example involves a frontend application where `ComponentA` imports and uses `ComponentB`, while `ComponentB` imports utilities from `ComponentA`, creating a circular module dependency. The JavaScript module loader fails to resolve the circular import, causing the application to fail during the bundling process.
