## Description

Circular references occur when two or more objects hold references to each other, either directly or through a chain of references, creating a cycle that prevents automatic garbage collection from reclaiming the memory. In languages with reference counting garbage collection, circular references can prevent objects from being deallocated even when they are no longer reachable from the application's root objects, leading to memory leaks and potential system instability.

## Indicators ⟡

- Memory usage grows continuously despite objects appearing to go out of scope
- Garbage collection doesn't reclaim memory for objects that should be eligible for cleanup
- Application performance degrades over time due to increasing memory consumption
- Memory profiling reveals objects that remain allocated longer than expected
- Reference counting shows non-zero counts for objects that should be unreachable

## Symptoms ▲
- [Unbounded Data Structures](unbounded-data-structures.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.329, Strength: 0.583">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Circular references prevent the effective garbage collection of objects, causing them to accumulate in memory, which in turn leads to unbounded data structures that grow uncontrollably and degrade system performance.

## Detection Methods ○

- **Memory Profilers:** Use heap analysis tools to identify object reference chains and detect circular patterns
- **Reference Graph Analysis:** Visualize object reference graphs to identify cycles in the dependency structure
- **Garbage Collection Monitoring:** Monitor GC effectiveness and identify objects that survive multiple collection cycles
- **Memory Leak Detection Tools:** Use language-specific tools designed to detect and analyze memory leaks
- **Static Code Analysis:** Analyze code for patterns that commonly create circular references
- **Load Testing:** Run extended tests to observe memory growth patterns over time

## Examples

A document editing application has Document objects that contain Page objects, and each Page maintains a reference back to its parent Document for navigation purposes. When documents are closed, the mutual references prevent garbage collection from reclaiming either the Document or Page objects, causing memory to accumulate with each opened and closed document. Another example involves a web application where DOM event handlers capture references to business objects, while those business objects maintain references to DOM elements for updates. This creates a cycle between the JavaScript objects and DOM nodes that prevents browser garbage collection from cleaning up UI components when they're removed from the page, leading to memory bloat in single-page applications.
