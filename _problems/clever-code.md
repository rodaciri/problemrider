## Description

Clever code refers to implementations that prioritize demonstrating the author's technical sophistication over clarity, maintainability, and readability. This type of code often uses advanced language features, obscure algorithms, or overly condensed logic that may be technically impressive but creates significant barriers for other developers who need to understand, modify, or debug it. While the original author may feel proud of their technical prowess, clever code becomes a maintenance burden that slows down the entire team.


## Indicators ⟡
- Code that requires extensive study to understand basic functionality
- Heavy use of advanced language features when simpler alternatives would suffice
- Comments that explain "how" the code works rather than "why" it exists
- Other developers avoid modifying certain sections of code
- Code reviews focus more on deciphering logic than evaluating correctness

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○
- **Code Complexity Metrics:** Use tools to measure cyclomatic complexity, nesting depth, and other complexity indicators
- **Code Review Feedback:** Track review comments that ask for clarification or simplification
- **Developer Interviews:** Ask team members about code areas they find difficult to understand or modify
- **Documentation Requirements:** Areas requiring extensive documentation may indicate overly clever implementations
- **Modification Frequency:** Code that is rarely modified may be avoided due to complexity


## Examples

A developer implements a data transformation function using advanced functional programming techniques, including currying, monads, and complex higher-order functions. While the implementation is mathematically elegant and executes in fewer lines of code, it requires deep understanding of functional programming concepts that most team members lack. When a bug is discovered in the transformation logic, it takes three developers two days to understand the code well enough to identify the issue, and the fix requires extensive testing because no one is confident about the side effects of modifying the complex functional chain. A simpler imperative implementation would have been easily understood and modified by any team member. Another example involves a sorting algorithm implemented using an obscure but theoretically optimal approach from academic literature. The algorithm performs marginally better than standard library functions but requires 200 lines of complex code with intricate pointer manipulation. When the data format changes, modifying the algorithm requires a computer science expert and introduces several memory leaks that take weeks to discover and fix.
