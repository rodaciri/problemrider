## Description

Code duplication occurs when similar or identical functionality is implemented in multiple places throughout a codebase. While some duplication might be intentional or harmless, excessive duplication creates maintenance nightmares as bugs must be fixed in multiple locations, features must be updated in several places, and inconsistencies inevitably emerge as different copies evolve independently. This problem is particularly common in legacy systems where different developers have solved similar problems in isolation.


## Indicators ⟡
- Similar logic appears in multiple files or functions
- Bug fixes need to be applied in several different locations
- Features are inconsistently implemented across different parts of the system
- Copy-paste patterns are evident in code history or structure
- Developers frequently ask "where else do I need to make this change?"


## Symptoms ▲

- [Legacy Skill Shortage](legacy-skill-shortage.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.351, Strength: 0.620">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Code duplication complicates the maintenance process, leading to reliance on a limited number of developers who possess the necessary legacy knowledge, thus creating a skill shortage that further exacerbates the challenges of managing an inconsistent codebase.
- [Frequent Changes to Requirements](frequent-changes-to-requirements.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.320, Strength: 0.532">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The presence of similar or identical code in multiple locations complicates understanding and adapting to changing requirements, resulting in frequent updates and rework as developers struggle to ensure consistency across duplicated code segments.

## Root Causes ▼

- [Shared Dependencies](shared-dependencies.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.429, Strength: 0.952">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The reliance on a common set of libraries and frameworks across multiple components often leads developers to replicate similar code to accommodate specific needs, thereby resulting in code duplication that complicates maintenance and increases inconsistency risks.
- [Procedural Background](procedural-background.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.395, Strength: 0.953">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The difficulty in transitioning to an object-oriented mindset leads developers to replicate procedural code patterns across the system, resulting in code duplication that complicates maintenance and increases the risk of inconsistencies.
- [Shared Database](shared-database.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.386, Strength: 0.932">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The reliance on a single database by multiple services encourages developers to copy and paste code for data access, leading to duplicated logic scattered across the system instead of promoting a centralized solution.
- [Tangled Cross-Cutting Concerns](tangled-cross-cutting-concerns.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.379, Strength: 0.964">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The intertwining of cross-cutting concerns with business logic often leads developers to replicate code across different modules to address these shared functionalities, thereby resulting in code duplication that complicates maintenance and increases the risk of inconsistencies.
- [Data Migration Complexities](data-migration-complexities.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.358, Strength: 0.878">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Complex data migration processes often lead to hurried or inconsistent implementations, resulting in similar or identical code being replicated across the system to accommodate various data formats or business rules, thereby increasing maintenance difficulties and inconsistency risks.
- [Deployment Coupling](deployment-coupling.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.337, Strength: 0.871">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The need to deploy multiple components together, regardless of whether only one has changed, often leads developers to duplicate code across these components to avoid integration issues, ultimately complicating maintenance and increasing the risk of inconsistencies.
- [Poor Encapsulation](poor-encapsulation.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.337, Strength: 0.894">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of bundling data with its associated behavior results in multiple code segments needing to replicate similar functionalities to access shared data, thereby increasing code duplication and complicating maintenance.
- [Testing Complexity](testing-complexity.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.335, Strength: 0.843">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The need to verify the same functionality across multiple code locations increases the likelihood of developers duplicating code to simplify testing, ultimately leading to maintenance challenges and inconsistencies in the software.
- [Incomplete Knowledge](incomplete-knowledge.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.330, Strength: 0.929">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Developers' lack of awareness about all instances of similar logic leads to unintentional code duplication, as they may replicate functionality without realizing it already exists elsewhere, complicating maintenance and increasing the risk of inconsistencies.
- [Uncontrolled Codebase Growth](uncontrolled-codebase-growth.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.322, Strength: 0.836">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The rapid and unplanned expansion of the codebase leads to developers copying and pasting similar code snippets across different modules to meet immediate needs, resulting in widespread code duplication that complicates maintenance and increases the risk of inconsistencies.
- [Imperative Data Fetching Logic](imperative-data-fetching-logic.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.312, Strength: 0.864">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The reliance on imperative data fetching logic forces developers to replicate similar code across multiple locations to handle data retrieval efficiently, thereby increasing code duplication and complicating maintenance.

## Detection Methods ○
- **Static Analysis Tools:** Use tools that can identify duplicate or similar code blocks across the codebase
- **Copy-Paste Detection:** Tools like CPD (Copy-Paste Detector) can find duplicated code segments
- **Code Review Patterns:** Watch for reviewers asking "isn't this similar to code in module X?"
- **Similarity Analysis:** Measure code similarity between modules to identify potential duplication
- **Bug Pattern Analysis:** Track bugs that need to be fixed in multiple locations as indicators of duplication


## Examples

An e-commerce system has three different user input validation routines: one for user registration, one for profile updates, and one for checkout forms. Each validates email addresses differently—the registration form accepts international domains, the profile update rejects certain special characters that registration allows, and the checkout form has its own set of rules. When a security vulnerability is discovered in email validation, the fix must be applied in three different places, but the developer only fixes two of them. This leads to inconsistent user experience and a security hole that persists in the checkout process. In another case, a financial application has identical currency formatting code copied across twelve different reporting modules. When the business requirements change to support a new currency format, developers must hunt down all twelve instances and hope they don't miss any, leading to reports that display currency inconsistently.
