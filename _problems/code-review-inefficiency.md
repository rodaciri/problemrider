## Description

Code review inefficiency occurs when the code review process consumes disproportionate time and effort relative to the value it provides, or when the process itself becomes a significant impediment to development velocity. This can manifest as reviews that take too long, provide superficial feedback, miss important issues, or create unnecessary back-and-forth discussions that don't improve code quality. Inefficient reviews waste developer time and can reduce team morale.

## Indicators ⟡

- Code reviews take much longer than the actual development time
- Reviews focus on style preferences rather than substantial issues
- Multiple review rounds are needed for simple changes
- Reviewers provide conflicting or contradictory feedback
- Important bugs or design issues are missed during reviews despite lengthy discussions

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○

- **Review Time Tracking:** Measure time spent on reviews relative to development time and change complexity
- **Review Round Analysis:** Track how many review iterations are needed for different types of changes
- **Review Feedback Classification:** Categorize review comments to identify what types of issues are being raised
- **Developer Surveys:** Collect feedback on the effectiveness and efficiency of the review process
- **Review Coverage Analysis:** Assess whether reviews are catching important issues or focusing on trivial concerns

## Examples

A team spends an average of 8 hours reviewing a 200-line feature implementation that took 4 hours to develop. The review process involves three rounds of feedback, with most comments focusing on variable naming preferences, code formatting, and minor style issues rather than logic, design, or potential bugs. Despite the extensive review time, a significant logic error makes it to production because reviewers were distracted by style discussions and didn't carefully examine the business logic. Another example involves a code review where five different reviewers provide conflicting advice about the same piece of code - one suggests extracting a method, another recommends inlining it, a third wants different variable names, and a fourth questions the entire approach. The author spends days trying to address all the feedback, and the review process takes longer than implementing three similar features from scratch.
