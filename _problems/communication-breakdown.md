## Description

Communication breakdown occurs when team members cannot effectively share information, coordinate their work, or collaborate on problem-solving. This failure in communication can result from various systemic issues including information silos, unclear communication channels, conflicting priorities, or cultural problems that discourage open dialogue. In software development, communication breakdown leads to duplicated effort, inconsistent implementations, and missed opportunities for knowledge sharing and collective problem-solving.

## Indicators ⟡

- Team members frequently work on similar or overlapping problems without awareness
- Important decisions are made without consulting relevant stakeholders
- Information about system changes, issues, or solutions doesn't reach affected team members
- Meetings are ineffective and don't result in clear decisions or action items
- Team members express frustration about not knowing what others are working on

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Duplicated Effort](duplicated-effort.md):** Multiple team members solve the same problems independently
- **[Knowledge Silos](knowledge-silos.md):** Critical information remains isolated with specific individuals
- **[Team Coordination Issues](team-coordination-issues.md):** Teams struggle to align their work and priorities
- **[Misaligned Deliverables](misaligned-deliverables.md):** Different team members build conflicting or incompatible solutions
- **[Decision Paralysis](decision-paralysis.md):** Important decisions are delayed due to communication failures
- **Conflict Escalation:** Disagreements escalate due to poor communication

## Root Causes ▼

- **Information Silos:** Knowledge and decisions are confined to specific teams or individuals
- **Communication Channel Problems:** Unclear or ineffective methods for sharing information
- **Cultural Barriers:** Team culture discourages asking questions or sharing problems
- **Geographic Distribution:** Remote work or distributed teams create communication challenges
- **Time Zone Differences:** Team members can't communicate synchronously
- **Tool Fragmentation:** Communication tools are scattered and information is hard to find
- **Hierarchical Communication:** Information must flow through management layers, creating delays
- **Competing Priorities:** Team members are too focused on individual goals to collaborate

## Detection Methods ○

- **Information Flow Analysis:** Track how effectively information moves through the team
- **Communication Frequency Assessment:** Monitor how often team members interact and share updates
- **Duplication Detection:** Identify instances where team members unknowingly work on similar problems
- **Decision-Making Speed:** Measure how quickly teams can make collaborative decisions
- **Team Satisfaction Surveys:** Ask team members about communication effectiveness
- **Meeting Effectiveness Analysis:** Evaluate whether meetings lead to clear outcomes and action items

## Examples

A development team working on a customer portal has two developers independently implementing user authentication features because they weren't aware of each other's work. The lack of communication results in two different authentication approaches being built simultaneously, creating integration conflicts and wasted development time. Neither developer was aware the other had started the same work because they were assigned through different project management systems and didn't have regular technical coordination meetings. Another example involves a platform team that makes significant infrastructure changes without communicating with application teams that depend on their services. When the infrastructure changes cause application failures, the application teams spend days debugging issues that could have been avoided with advance notice and coordination about the infrastructure modifications.
