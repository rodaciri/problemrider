## Description

Communication risk outside the project occurs when there is inadequate information flow between the project team and external stakeholders, including customers, executives, other departments, and vendors. This creates situations where stakeholders have unrealistic expectations, are surprised by project outcomes, or make decisions based on outdated or incomplete information. Poor external communication can damage relationships, reduce support for the project, and lead to misaligned business decisions.

## Indicators ⟡

- Stakeholders express surprise about project status, delays, or changes
- External parties make decisions that conflict with current project direction
- Stakeholders have different understanding of project scope and timeline than the team
- Important project information is not shared beyond the immediate team
- Stakeholder feedback is not incorporated into project planning and execution

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Stakeholder Confidence Loss](stakeholder-confidence-loss.md):** External stakeholders lose trust in project team's ability to deliver
- **[Misaligned Deliverables](misaligned-deliverables.md):** Project outputs don't match stakeholder expectations
- **[Scope Creep](scope-creep.md):** Stakeholders add requirements without understanding impact on timeline or budget
- **Resource Allocation Conflicts:** External decisions affect project resources unexpectedly
- **Business Impact Misunderstanding:** Stakeholders don't understand project's business value or risks

## Root Causes ▼

- **Inadequate Communication Plan:** No systematic approach to external stakeholder communication
- **[Time Pressure](time-pressure.md):** Team focuses on execution without allocating time for stakeholder communication
- **Unclear Stakeholder Mapping:** Team doesn't identify all relevant external parties
- **Communication Skills Gap:** Team lacks skills to communicate effectively with non-technical stakeholders
- **Organizational Silos:** Departmental boundaries prevent effective information sharing

## Detection Methods ○

- **Stakeholder Satisfaction Surveys:** Regular feedback from external stakeholders about communication effectiveness
- **Expectation Alignment Assessment:** Compare stakeholder expectations with actual project plans
- **Communication Frequency Analysis:** Track how often external stakeholders receive project updates
- **Surprise Event Tracking:** Document instances where stakeholders are caught off-guard by project developments
- **Stakeholder Engagement Measurement:** Assess level of stakeholder involvement and input in project decisions

## Examples

A development team builds a new customer portal based on requirements gathered six months ago, but they don't communicate progress or gather feedback from the business stakeholders during development. When they deliver the completed system, the business users are disappointed because their needs have evolved during the development period, and the portal doesn't support several critical workflows that became important during that time. The business stakeholders feel the development team wasted their time and budget building something that doesn't meet current needs. Another example involves an IT infrastructure upgrade project where the team fails to communicate planned downtime windows to customer-facing departments. When the upgrade requires unexpected additional maintenance windows, customer service representatives are caught off-guard by system outages and cannot explain the situation to frustrated customers. The lack of communication damages relationships between IT and customer service, and customers lose confidence in the company's reliability.
