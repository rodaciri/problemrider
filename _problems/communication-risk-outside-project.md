## Description

Communication risk outside the project occurs when there is inadequate information flow between the project team and external stakeholders, including customers, executives, other departments, and vendors. This creates situations where stakeholders have unrealistic expectations, are surprised by project outcomes, or make decisions based on outdated or incomplete information. Poor external communication can damage relationships, reduce support for the project, and lead to misaligned business decisions.


## Indicators ⟡

- Stakeholders express surprise about project status, delays, or changes
- External parties make decisions that conflict with current project direction
- Stakeholders have different understanding of project scope and timeline than the team
- Important project information is not shared beyond the immediate team
- Stakeholder feedback is not incorporated into project planning and execution


## Symptoms ▲

- [Frequent Changes to Requirements](frequent-changes-to-requirements.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.511, Strength: 0.747">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Frequent updates to project requirements often stem from external stakeholders' lack of awareness about the current project status, leading to miscommunication and the need for adjustments that create rework and delays.
- [Inefficient Development Environment](inefficient-development-environment.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.391, Strength: 0.689">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  A slow and cumbersome development environment can lead to incomplete or delayed updates being communicated to external stakeholders, resulting in misaligned expectations and surprises about project progress.
- [Project Authority Vacuum](project-authority-vacuum.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.369, Strength: 0.698">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of clear communication with external stakeholders creates an authority vacuum, as insufficiently informed executives are less likely to advocate for the project, resulting in inadequate support and resources necessary for overcoming resistance.
- [Legacy Skill Shortage](legacy-skill-shortage.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.368, Strength: 0.671">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of effective communication with external stakeholders exacerbates the legacy skill shortage by preventing the identification of critical knowledge gaps and the allocation of resources needed to bridge them, leading to increased project risks and system maintenance challenges.
- [Unreleased Resources](unreleased-resources.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.336, Strength: 0.623">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Poor communication with external stakeholders can lead to a lack of clarity regarding resource allocation and usage, resulting in unreleased resources as teams may not be aware of dependencies or changes needed to properly deallocate system components, ultimately indicating a breakdown in project oversight and coordination.
- [Poor Project Control](poor-project-control.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.309, Strength: 0.795">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Ineffective monitoring of project progress due to inadequate communication with external stakeholders results in a lack of timely updates, ultimately allowing issues to escalate unnoticed and jeopardizing project alignment and recovery efforts.
- [Inadequate Test Data Management](inadequate-test-data-management.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.300, Strength: 0.782">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Poor communication with external stakeholders often results in outdated or insufficient test data being utilized, as stakeholders may not provide relevant real-world scenarios or requirements, leading to misaligned expectations in project outcomes.

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○

- **Stakeholder Satisfaction Surveys:** Regular feedback from external stakeholders about communication effectiveness
- **Expectation Alignment Assessment:** Compare stakeholder expectations with actual project plans
- **Communication Frequency Analysis:** Track how often external stakeholders receive project updates
- **Surprise Event Tracking:** Document instances where stakeholders are caught off-guard by project developments
- **Stakeholder Engagement Measurement:** Assess level of stakeholder involvement and input in project decisions


## Examples

A development team builds a new customer portal based on requirements gathered six months ago, but they don't communicate progress or gather feedback from the business stakeholders during development. When they deliver the completed system, the business users are disappointed because their needs have evolved during the development period, and the portal doesn't support several critical workflows that became important during that time. The business stakeholders feel the development team wasted their time and budget building something that doesn't meet current needs. Another example involves an IT infrastructure upgrade project where the team fails to communicate planned downtime windows to customer-facing departments. When the upgrade requires unexpected additional maintenance windows, customer service representatives are caught off-guard by system outages and cannot explain the situation to frustrated customers. The lack of communication damages relationships between IT and customer service, and customers lose confidence in the company's reliability.
