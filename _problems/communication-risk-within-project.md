## Description

Communication risk within projects occurs when team members cannot effectively share information, understand each other's messages, or coordinate their activities. This includes unclear requirements, ambiguous technical discussions, missed messages, and assumptions that lead to misunderstandings. Poor internal project communication creates confusion about priorities, duplicated effort, and decisions based on incomplete or incorrect information.

## Indicators ⟡

- Team members frequently ask for clarification on previously discussed topics
- Different team members have different understanding of the same requirements
- Important decisions are made without all relevant stakeholders being informed
- Messages and documentation are ambiguous or subject to multiple interpretations
- Team meetings frequently involve confusion about what was previously agreed upon

## Symptoms ▲
- [Frequent Changes to Requirements](frequent-changes-to-requirements.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.471, Strength: 0.683">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Frequent updates to project requirements often stem from miscommunication and unclear messaging among team members, which leads to misunderstandings about project goals and priorities, ultimately resulting in increased rework and delays.
- [Poor Project Control](poor-project-control.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.415, Strength: 0.886">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Ineffective communication leads to a lack of clarity in project objectives and status updates, resulting in inadequate monitoring and oversight of project progress, which allows issues to escalate unnoticed in legacy systems.
- [Review Process Breakdown](review-process-breakdown.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.387, Strength: 0.625">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Ineffective communication among team members leads to misunderstandings about coding standards and expectations, causing the review process to break down as reviewers fail to provide relevant feedback or identify critical issues due to a lack of clarity and trust in the project's objectives.
- [Poor Contract Design](poor-contract-design.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.316, Strength: 0.939">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of clear communication leads to misunderstandings about project requirements, resulting in poorly designed contracts that fail to capture the technical needs and flexibility necessary for effective collaboration in legacy systems.
- [Inadequate Configuration Management](inadequate-configuration-management.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.310, Strength: 0.904">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Poor communication among team members leads to inconsistent understanding and documentation of system configurations, resulting in inadequate tracking of code and infrastructure versions, which manifests as errors and rollback issues in legacy systems.
- [Team Members Not Engaged in Review Process](team-members-not-engaged-in-review-process.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.301, Strength: 0.652">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of clear communication leads to team members feeling unaligned and disengaged, resulting in insufficient participation in the review process and ineffective feedback, which ultimately hampers the quality of the legacy system's code.

## Root Causes ▼
- [Large Estimates for Small Changes](large-estimates-for-small-changes.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.316, Strength: 0.817">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The tendency to provide large time estimates for minor changes highlights the underlying complexity and unpredictability of the legacy code, leading to misunderstandings and diminished trust among team members as they struggle to communicate effectively about the true scope and risks involved in the project.
- [Increased Time to Market](increased-time-to-market.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.305, Strength: 0.921">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The prolonged time to market creates pressure on teams to rush communication and decision-making, leading to misunderstandings and unclear messages that hinder coordination and trust among project members.
- [Tangled Cross-Cutting Concerns](tangled-cross-cutting-concerns.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.302, Strength: 0.938">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Tangled cross-cutting concerns create ambiguity in the system's architecture, leading to unclear communication and misunderstandings among team members as they struggle to navigate the intertwined complexities of business logic and technical requirements.

## Detection Methods ○

- **Communication Pattern Analysis:** Track frequency and effectiveness of different communication methods
- **Meeting Effectiveness Assessment:** Evaluate whether meetings result in clear understanding and decisions
- **Message Clarity Testing:** Review documentation and messages for ambiguity or confusion
- **Decision Traceability Review:** Assess whether team members understand how and why decisions were made
- **Team Understanding Surveys:** Regular check-ins about clarity of communication and shared understanding

## Examples

A development team receives requirements from the product owner that state "users should be able to search efficiently." The backend team interprets this as needing to optimize database queries, the frontend team focuses on user interface responsiveness, and the product owner actually meant users should be able to find results quickly regardless of technical implementation. Each team works on their interpretation for weeks before discovering the misalignment during a demo, requiring significant rework to create a cohesive solution. Another example involves a distributed team where developers in different time zones use email for all communication. A critical bug is reported via email, but the developer responsible doesn't see the message until the next day because it was buried among other emails. Meanwhile, other team members start working on the same bug because they assume no one is addressing it, leading to duplicated effort and confusion about which fix to use.
