## Description

Complex implementation paths occur when straightforward business requirements must be implemented through convoluted, multi-step technical solutions due to architectural constraints, design limitations, or accumulated technical debt. What should be simple features become complex projects requiring extensive workarounds, multiple system modifications, or elaborate integration patterns. This complexity mismatch between business simplicity and technical implementation indicates underlying architectural problems.

## Indicators ⟡

- Simple feature requests receive unexpectedly large development estimates
- Implementation plans involve many steps for conceptually simple requirements
- Multiple systems must be modified to implement single business features
- Technical solutions are much more complex than the business problems they solve
- Developers frequently explain why "simple" requests are actually difficult

## Detection Methods ○

- **Implementation Complexity Analysis:** Compare business requirement complexity with technical implementation complexity
- **Estimate vs. Actual Tracking:** Monitor how often simple features require unexpectedly large efforts
- **Architecture Review:** Assess how well current architecture supports typical business requirements
- **Developer Feedback:** Survey team about architectural pain points and implementation challenges
- **Feature Delivery Metrics:** Track time from simple business requirement to production deployment

## Examples

Adding a "favorite products" feature to an e-commerce site requires modifying the user database schema, updating three different API endpoints, changing four different frontend components, implementing new caching logic, and updating two separate recommendation algorithms because the original system wasn't designed with user preferences in mind. A business requirement that should be a simple database table and basic UI becomes a month-long project touching dozens of files. Another example involves implementing a "send email notification" feature that requires building custom message queuing, implementing retry logic, creating new database tables, and modifying the authentication system because the monolithic architecture doesn't support simple integrations with external services.
