## Description

Customer dissatisfaction occurs when users experience frustration, disappointment, or anger with software systems due to reliability problems, poor performance, confusing interfaces, or unmet expectations. This dissatisfaction can manifest as complaints, support requests, reduced usage, or customer churn. In legacy systems, dissatisfaction often accumulates over time as technical debt impacts user experience.

## Indicators ⟡

- Increasing customer complaints about system issues
- Higher support ticket volumes related to system problems
- Declining user engagement or usage metrics
- Customer churn or cancellation requests citing system issues
- Negative feedback about system reliability or usability

## Symptoms ▲

- **[User Trust Erosion](user-trust-erosion.md):** Users lose confidence in system reliability
- **[Competitive Disadvantage](competitive-disadvantage.md):** Poor experience drives users to alternative solutions
- **Revenue Impact:** Customer dissatisfaction affects business revenue
- **[Negative Brand Perception](negative-brand-perception.md):** Poor user experience harms organization's reputation

## Root Causes ▼

## Examples

An online banking system experiences increasing customer complaints as page load times grow from 2 seconds to 10+ seconds over six months due to accumulated performance issues. Customers report frustration with timeout errors during transactions and inconsistent behavior across different browsers. Customer support tickets increase by 300%, and several large clients threaten to switch to competitors citing poor user experience. Another example involves a project management tool where users become increasingly frustrated with a confusing interface that requires multiple clicks for simple tasks, frequent data loss during system updates, and features that don't work as expected, leading to a 40% increase in cancellation requests.
