## Description

Data migration complexities occur when moving data between systems, upgrading database schemas, or transforming data formats becomes overly complicated, risky, or time-consuming. Complex migrations can lead to data loss, corruption, extended downtime, or failed deployments, especially when dealing with large datasets, complex transformations, or systems that must remain operational during migration.


## Indicators ⟡

- Data migrations requiring extended system downtime
- Migration processes that frequently fail or require rollback
- Complex data transformation logic that's difficult to verify
- Manual intervention required during automated migration processes
- Different data formats or structures between source and target systems

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○

- **Migration Process Analysis:** Review migration procedures for complexity and risk factors
- **Historical Migration Metrics:** Analyze past migration success rates and downtime
- **Data Volume Impact Assessment:** Evaluate how data size affects migration duration
- **Migration Testing Coverage:** Assess how thoroughly migration processes are tested
- **Rollback Strategy Validation:** Test migration rollback procedures and recovery options


## Examples

A financial application needs to migrate customer account data from a legacy database to a new system, but the migration involves complex business rule transformations that convert account types, recalculate balances, and merge duplicate records. The migration process takes 18 hours for the full dataset and requires the system to be offline during the entire process. Any failure mid-migration leaves the system in an inconsistent state that's difficult to recover from. Another example involves migrating user data from separate user profile and preference systems into a unified user management system. The migration requires joining data from three different databases, transforming user role hierarchies, and handling conflicting user preferences. The complexity of these transformations makes it difficult to validate that all user data migrated correctly, and the process frequently fails due to data inconsistencies that aren't discovered until runtime.
