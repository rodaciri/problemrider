## Description

Data structure cache inefficiency occurs when data is organized in memory layouts that work against CPU cache behavior, causing frequent cache misses and poor memory access patterns. This includes structures with poor spatial locality, excessive pointer indirection, misaligned data, or layouts that don't match access patterns, resulting in performance that's much worse than theoretical algorithmic complexity would suggest.


## Indicators ⟡

- Data structure operations perform much slower than expected algorithmic complexity
- Performance scales poorly with data size due to cache effects rather than algorithm complexity
- Memory access patterns show poor spatial and temporal locality
- Cache miss rates are high during data structure operations
- Performance varies significantly based on data layout rather than data volume

## Root Causes ▼

- [Slow Response Times for Lists](slow-response-times-for-lists.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.321, Strength: 0.933">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Inefficient data fetching for lists leads to non-contiguous memory access patterns, which exacerbate cache misses and degrade performance, ultimately causing increased memory access latency and reduced throughput in legacy systems.
- [Poor Encapsulation](poor-encapsulation.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.311, Strength: 0.942">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Inefficient data structure organization arises from a lack of cohesive bundling of related data and behavior, resulting in high coupling that disrupts optimal memory locality and cache utilization, ultimately leading to increased access latency and reduced throughput.

## Detection Methods ○

- **Cache Performance Profiling:** Analyze cache hit/miss rates for specific data structure operations
- **Memory Access Pattern Analysis:** Study memory access patterns during data structure operations
- **Performance Scaling Tests:** Test performance across different data sizes to identify cache effects
- **Data Layout Visualization:** Visualize how data is laid out in memory relative to access patterns
- **Comparative Benchmarking:** Compare different data layout strategies for the same algorithm
- **Hardware Performance Counters:** Monitor CPU cache behavior during data structure operations


## Examples

A 3D graphics application stores vertex data using an array of structures where each vertex contains position, normal, texture coordinates, and color data interleaved. During rendering, the application typically accesses only position data for transformation calculations, but because all vertex attributes are interleaved, each position access loads an entire cache line containing mostly unused data, wasting memory bandwidth and cache space. Restructuring to separate arrays for each attribute (structure of arrays) would improve cache efficiency by 4x. Another example involves a database-style application using a linked list to store records where each node is allocated separately. Traversing the list causes a cache miss for every node access because nodes are scattered throughout memory, making linear traversal extremely slow compared to an array-based structure where sequential nodes are stored contiguously.
