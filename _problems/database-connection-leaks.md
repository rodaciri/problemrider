## Description

Database connection leaks occur when applications open database connections but fail to properly close them when they are no longer needed. This leads to the gradual depletion of the connection pool, eventually causing new database operations to fail when no connections are available. Connection leaks are particularly problematic in high-traffic applications and can cause complete service outages that require application restarts to resolve.

## Indicators ⟡

- Application fails to execute database queries with "connection pool exhausted" errors
- Database monitoring shows steadily increasing number of active connections
- Application performance degrades over time as available connections diminish
- Database operations timeout or fail after the application has been running for a period
- Connection pool metrics show high utilization with low throughput

## Symptoms ▲
- [Upstream Timeouts](upstream-timeouts.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.638, Strength: 0.830">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The failure to properly close database connections leads to exhaustion of the connection pool, causing delays in response times that exceed the configured timeout limits for services relying on API interactions, thereby resulting in upstream timeouts.
- [Poor Caching Strategy](poor-caching-strategy.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.468, Strength: 0.799">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The failure to properly close database connections leads to a depletion of available resources, forcing the application to repeatedly fetch data from the source instead of utilizing cached results, which in turn exacerbates latency and operational inefficiencies.
- [Negative User Feedback](negative-user-feedback.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.406, Strength: 0.830">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The failure to close database connections leads to exhaustion of the connection pool, resulting in slow application response times and freezes, which users experience as negative performance, thus serving as an indicator of underlying resource management issues.
- [Data Migration Integrity Issues](data-migration-integrity-issues.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.401, Strength: 0.852">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Improperly closed database connections can lead to resource exhaustion, causing timeouts and failures during data migration processes, which in turn result in integrity issues due to incomplete or interrupted data transfers.
- [Unreleased Resources](unreleased-resources.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.388, Strength: 0.770">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The failure to properly close database connections results in unreleased resources, as each unclosed connection occupies a slot in the connection pool, leading to resource exhaustion and subsequent application errors in legacy systems.
- [Inefficient Code](inefficient-code.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.339, Strength: 0.813">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Inefficient code can exacerbate database connection leaks by prolonging the time each connection remains open, as prolonged processing delays the closure of connections, ultimately leading to exhaustion of the connection pool and increasing the likelihood of application failures.
- [Memory Leaks](memory-leaks.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.326, Strength: 0.831">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The failure to properly close database connections can lead to an accumulation of unused resources, which in turn prevents the release of memory, resulting in memory leaks that signal underlying connection management issues in legacy systems.
- [Incorrect Max Connection Pool Size](incorrect-max-connection-pool-size.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.323, Strength: 0.829">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  When database connections are not properly closed, it can lead to a situation where the actual number of active connections exceeds the incorrectly configured maximum pool size, resulting in connection exhaustion that indicates the presence of leaks in the connection management process.
- [Memory Barrier Inefficiency](memory-barrier-inefficiency.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.312, Strength: 0.860">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Connection leaks lead to increased pressure on system resources, which can cause excessive synchronization and inefficient memory barriers as threads struggle to manage the limited pool of connections, ultimately degrading performance in multi-threaded environments.

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○

- **Connection Pool Monitoring:** Monitor database connection pool usage, active connections, and pool exhaustion events
- **Database Connection Tracking:** Track database connection lifecycle from creation to closure
- **Application Performance Monitoring:** Monitor database operation response times and failure rates
- **Resource Leak Detection:** Use profiling tools to identify unreleased database connections
- **Load Testing:** Run sustained load tests to identify connection leak patterns
- **Database Server Monitoring:** Monitor active connections at the database server level

## Examples

A web application opens database connections in a try block to execute queries but only closes them in the main execution path, not in the exception handling paths. When database queries fail due to temporary network issues, the connections remain open and are never returned to the pool. After several hours of intermittent database errors, the connection pool is exhausted and the application can no longer serve any requests that require database access. Another example involves a batch processing system that opens database connections inside loops but closes them outside the loop. When the loop processes thousands of records, thousands of connections are opened but only one is closed, quickly exhausting the connection pool and causing the batch process to fail.
