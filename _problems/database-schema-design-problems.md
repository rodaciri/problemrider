## Description

Database schema design problems occur when database structures are poorly planned, inadequately normalized or denormalized, or don't efficiently support the application's data access patterns. Poor schema design leads to performance issues, data integrity problems, complex queries, and maintenance difficulties that become more pronounced as the system scales.


## Indicators ⟡

- Queries requiring complex joins across many tables for simple operations
- Data redundancy and inconsistency across different tables
- Tables with excessive numbers of columns or very wide rows
- Frequent schema modifications needed to support new features
- Performance issues that can't be resolved through indexing alone


## Symptoms ▲

- [Poor Caching Strategy](poor-caching-strategy.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.407, Strength: 0.817">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Inefficient database schema design leads to complex queries that fail to optimize data retrieval, resulting in a reliance on fetching data from the source for each request, which serves as an indicator of underlying performance issues.
- [Inadequate Test Data Management](inadequate-test-data-management.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.371, Strength: 0.879">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Poor database schema design often leads to complex and convoluted data structures that make it difficult to generate realistic and comprehensive test data, resulting in inadequate test data management that fails to reveal underlying issues in the system.
- [Monolithic Architecture Constraints](monolithic-architecture-constraints.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.340, Strength: 0.724">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Inefficient database schema design leads to tightly coupled data access patterns that complicate the codebase, making it challenging to maintain and scale the application as it evolves.
- [Legacy API Versioning Nightmare](legacy-api-versioning-nightmare.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.322, Strength: 0.785">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Poorly designed database schemas lead to inefficient data structures that make API interactions cumbersome, resulting in challenges with versioning and backward compatibility as changes are made to accommodate evolving data requirements.
- [Poor Domain Model](poor-domain-model.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.316, Strength: 0.871">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Ineffective database schema design can lead to a misalignment between the system's structure and core business concepts, resulting in a poor reflection of the domain model that manifests as fragile logic and miscommunication within the application.

## Root Causes ▼

- [Imperative Data Fetching Logic](imperative-data-fetching-logic.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.308, Strength: 0.887">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Inefficient data fetching in a loop exacerbates performance issues and increases the complexity of schema interactions, ultimately leading to greater data integrity problems and maintenance challenges in legacy systems.
- [Data Migration Complexities](data-migration-complexities.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.301, Strength: 0.935">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Complex data migration processes often lead to inadequate schema adjustments, resulting in performance issues and data integrity challenges that stem from the inability to effectively map legacy data structures to optimized designs.

## Detection Methods ○

- **Schema Complexity Analysis:** Analyze table structures, relationships, and normalization levels
- **Query Performance Impact Assessment:** Evaluate how schema design affects query performance
- **Data Redundancy Auditing:** Identify duplicate data storage across different tables
- **Schema Change Frequency Monitoring:** Track how often schema modifications are required
- **Referential Integrity Validation:** Check for proper foreign key relationships and constraints


## Examples

An e-commerce application uses a single "products" table with 200+ columns to store all product information, including specific attributes for different product categories. Most queries only need a few columns but must scan the entire wide table, causing performance issues. Product-specific attributes like "clothing_size" and "electronics_warranty" are stored in the same table, leading to many null values and confusion. Splitting this into a core products table with category-specific attribute tables would improve performance and maintainability. Another example involves a user management system where user profile information is stored across 15 highly normalized tables, requiring 8-table joins just to display a user profile page. While technically normalized, this creates excessive query complexity and poor performance. Selective denormalization by combining frequently accessed user data into fewer tables would improve performance without compromising data integrity.
