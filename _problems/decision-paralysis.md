## Description
Decision paralysis is a common problem in software development. It occurs when developers struggle to make choices without clear guidance. This can lead to a slowdown in development, a great deal of frustration for the development team, and a decline in team morale. Decision paralysis is often a sign of a lack of clear goals and priorities, a lack of autonomy, or a fear of failure.


## Indicators ⟡
- The team is constantly asking for permission to make decisions.
- The team is not making decisions in a timely manner.
- The team is not taking ownership of their work.
- The team is not happy with their work.

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○
- **Team Retrospectives:** Discuss the team's feelings about decision-making in your retrospectives.
- **Decision Log:** Keep a log of all decisions that are made and see how long it takes to make them.
- **Developer Surveys:** Ask developers about their feelings about their level of autonomy.
- **Team Morale:** Track team morale to see if it is being impacted by decision paralysis.


## Examples
A team is working on a new feature. The team is not sure how to implement the feature, and they are not able to make a decision. The team is constantly asking for permission to make decisions, and they are not making any progress. The project is eventually canceled.
