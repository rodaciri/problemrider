## Description
Decision paralysis is a common problem in software development. It occurs when developers struggle to make choices without clear guidance. This can lead to a slowdown in development, a great deal of frustration for the development team, and a decline in team morale. Decision paralysis is often a sign of a lack of clear goals and priorities, a lack of autonomy, or a fear of failure.

## Indicators ⟡
- The team is constantly asking for permission to make decisions.
- The team is not making decisions in a timely manner.
- The team is not taking ownership of their work.
- The team is not happy with their work.

## Symptoms ▲
- **[Slow Development Velocity](slow-development-velocity.md):** The team is not able to make progress because they are not able to make decisions.
- **[Increased Cognitive Load](increased-cognitive-load.md):** The constant need to make decisions can lead to mental fatigue and a decrease in cognitive performance.
- **[Developer Frustration and Burnout](developer-frustration-and-burnout.md):** The lack of autonomy and the constant need to ask for permission can be a major source of stress and frustration for developers.
- **[Reduced Innovation](reduced-innovation.md):** The team is not able to innovate because they are not able to make decisions.

## Root Causes ▼
- **[Unclear Goals and Priorities](unclear-goals-and-priorities.md):** The team does not have a clear understanding of the project's goals and priorities.
- **[Micromanagement Culture](micromanagement-culture.md):** The team does not have the autonomy to make decisions.
- **[Fear of Failure](fear-of-failure.md):** The team is afraid to make decisions for fear of making the wrong one.
- **[Inadequate Configuration Management](inadequate-configuration-management.md):** The team does not have a clear process for making decisions.

## Detection Methods ○
- **Team Retrospectives:** Discuss the team's feelings about decision-making in your retrospectives.
- **Decision Log:** Keep a log of all decisions that are made and see how long it takes to make them.
- **Developer Surveys:** Ask developers about their feelings about their level of autonomy.
- **Team Morale:** Track team morale to see if it is being impacted by decision paralysis.

## Examples
A team is working on a new feature. The team is not sure how to implement the feature, and they are not able to make a decision. The team is constantly asking for permission to make decisions, and they are not making any progress. The project is eventually canceled.
