## Description
Delayed value delivery is the gap between when a feature is ready and when it is actually in the hands of users. This is a common problem in organizations with long release cycles and inefficient delivery processes. When value is delayed, the company is not getting the full return on its investment in software development. It is also missing out on opportunities to get feedback from users and to iterate on its products. In a fast-moving market, delayed value delivery can be a major competitive disadvantage.

## Indicators ⟡
- There is a long lead time between when a feature is requested and when it is delivered.
- The company is consistently late to market with new features.
- Users are complaining about the slow pace of innovation.
- The company is losing market share to more agile competitors.

<br/>  The excessive time and resources allocated to addressing urgent issues in legacy systems divert attention from planned development efforts, resulting in prolonged delays in delivering new features and fixes to users.
- [High Number of Database Queries](high-number-of-database-queries.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.308, Strength: 0.876">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The excessive number of database queries triggered by a single user request leads to slower response times and increased processing delays, ultimately resulting in users waiting longer for new features and bug fixes.

## Detection Methods ○
- **Lead Time for Changes:** Measure the time it takes for a change to go from code commit to production.
- **Deployment Frequency:** Measure how often the team deploys to production.
- **Time to Market:** Measure the time it takes for a new feature to go from idea to production.
- **Customer Satisfaction Surveys:** Ask customers about their satisfaction with the pace of innovation.

## Examples
A company has a great idea for a new feature. The development team works hard and gets the feature ready in a few weeks. However, the company only releases new software once a quarter. This means that the feature has to sit on the shelf for months before it is actually delivered to users. By the time the feature is finally released, the market has moved on, and the feature is no longer as valuable as it once was.
