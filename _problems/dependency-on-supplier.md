## Description

Dependency on supplier occurs when an organization becomes overly reliant on external vendors for critical system components, services, or expertise, creating strategic vulnerabilities and reducing autonomy. This dependency can manifest as technical lock-in, knowledge dependency, or operational reliance that makes it difficult or expensive to change suppliers or bring capabilities in-house.

## Indicators ⟡

- Critical system functionality depends on vendor-specific technologies or services
- Organization lacks internal expertise to maintain or modify vendor-supplied components
- Switching costs to alternative suppliers are prohibitively high
- Vendor has significant control over roadmap, pricing, or service levels
- Organization cannot operate effectively if vendor relationship ends

## Symptoms ▲
- [Legacy Skill Shortage](legacy-skill-shortage.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.617, Strength: 0.881">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The reliance on external vendors for critical system components limits the development of in-house expertise, resulting in a shortage of skilled developers familiar with legacy technologies, which in turn creates maintenance bottlenecks and increases the risk of system failures.
- [Technical Architecture Limitations](technical-architecture-limitations.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.470, Strength: 0.829">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The reliance on external vendors for critical components leads to a rigid system architecture that is unable to adapt or evolve, thereby manifesting as limitations in performance, scalability, and maintainability.
- [Project Authority Vacuum](project-authority-vacuum.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.442, Strength: 0.797">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The reliance on external vendors for critical system components leads to a lack of internal authority and support for projects, as decision-makers prioritize vendor relationships over organizational initiatives, resulting in insufficient backing and resources for essential projects.
- [Regulatory Compliance Drift](regulatory-compliance-drift.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.415, Strength: 0.669">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The reliance on external vendors for critical system components hinders the organization’s ability to adapt swiftly to changing regulatory requirements, leading to compliance drift as updates become dependent on the vendor's priorities and timelines.
- [Vendor Lock-In](vendor-lock-in.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.352, Strength: 0.827">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The reliance on external vendors for critical components leads to an over-dependence on their specific tools or APIs, which restricts the organization's ability to adapt or switch to alternative solutions, thus highlighting the risks of reduced flexibility and increased lock-in.

## Root Causes ▼
- [Shared Dependencies](shared-dependencies.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.394, Strength: 0.945">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The reliance on a common set of libraries and frameworks among multiple components leads to an increased dependency on external vendors, as changes or updates to these shared resources can necessitate vendor involvement, thereby reducing flexibility and increasing lock-in risk.

## Detection Methods ○

- **Vendor Dependency Mapping:** Identify and assess all critical vendor dependencies
- **Switching Cost Analysis:** Calculate costs and effort required to change vendors for critical services
- **Vendor Performance Monitoring:** Track vendor performance and relationship health over time
- **Alternative Supplier Assessment:** Evaluate availability and viability of alternative suppliers
- **Internal Capability Gap Analysis:** Assess organization's ability to reduce vendor dependencies

## Examples

A company builds their entire customer management system on a proprietary platform from a specific vendor. Over five years, they develop hundreds of custom integrations and workflows specific to that platform. When the vendor significantly increases licensing costs and reduces support quality, the company discovers that migrating to an alternative would require rebuilding most of their system at a cost of millions of dollars and years of effort. Another example involves an organization that outsources all database administration to a vendor, failing to maintain any internal database expertise. When performance problems arise, they cannot diagnose issues independently and must rely entirely on the vendor's availability and expertise, leading to extended downtime and high support costs.
