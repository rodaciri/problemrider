## Description

Dependency version conflicts occur when applications or their dependencies require different versions of the same library, creating incompatibilities that can cause build failures, runtime errors, or unexpected behavior. These conflicts are particularly common in complex applications with many dependencies or when upgrading libraries without considering transitive dependency impacts.


## Indicators ⟡

- Build processes fail due to conflicting dependency requirements
- Runtime errors related to missing methods or incompatible interfaces
- Applications behave differently with seemingly identical dependency lists
- Package managers report version resolution conflicts
- Different behavior between development and production due to dependency variations


## Symptoms ▲

- [Upstream Timeouts](upstream-timeouts.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.411, Strength: 0.601">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Conflicting dependency versions can lead to incompatible API calls or altered response formats, causing services to exceed their configured timeout periods when attempting to retrieve data from those APIs.
- [Flaky Tests](flaky-tests.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.386, Strength: 0.688">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Conflicting versions of dependencies can lead to unpredictable behavior in the application, causing tests to fail intermittently as the environment changes unexpectedly, thus undermining confidence in test reliability within legacy systems.
- [Inconsistent Naming Conventions](inconsistent-naming-conventions.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.378, Strength: 0.717">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Conflicting dependency versions can lead to unstructured naming in code as developers attempt to accommodate multiple versions, resulting in inconsistent conventions that hinder readability and maintenance.

## Root Causes ▼

- [Shared Dependencies](shared-dependencies.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.394, Strength: 0.953">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  When multiple components within a legacy system rely on the same libraries, differing version requirements can lead to conflicts that compromise application stability and functionality.
- [Increasing Brittleness](increasing-brittleness.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.303, Strength: 0.861">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  As software systems age and accumulate complexity, their increasing brittleness leads to tighter coupling and reliance on specific dependency versions, making it more likely that conflicts will arise when updates or changes are made, resulting in runtime errors and build failures.

## Detection Methods ○

- **Dependency Auditing:** Regularly audit dependency trees for version conflicts
- **Build Reproducibility Testing:** Test builds across different environments for consistency
- **Dependency Version Analysis:** Analyze dependency version constraints and conflicts
- **Compatibility Testing:** Test application functionality after dependency updates
- **Lock File Validation:** Ensure lock files accurately represent dependency state


## Examples

A Node.js application depends on Library A version 2.x and Library B version 3.x, but Library B has a transitive dependency on Library A version 1.x. The package manager resolves this by installing Library A version 1.x, causing the application's direct usage of Library A to fail because it expects version 2.x APIs that don't exist in version 1.x. This causes runtime errors that are difficult to debug because the dependency conflict isn't obvious. Another example involves a Java application where two different libraries include different versions of the Apache Commons library. Maven resolves this by choosing one version, but the application code and one of the libraries expect different method signatures, leading to NoSuchMethodError exceptions at runtime that only occur with specific code paths.
