## Description
Deployment coupling is a situation where multiple components or services must be deployed together, even if only one of them has changed. This is a common problem in monolithic architectures, where all the components are tightly coupled and deployed as a single unit. Deployment coupling can lead to long release cycles, large and risky releases, and a great deal of anxiety for the development team.

## Indicators ⟡
- A small change to one component requires the entire system to be redeployed.
- It is not possible to deploy different components of the system independently.
- The deployment process is complex and error-prone.
- The development team is afraid to make changes to the system because they are afraid of breaking something.

<br/>  In legacy systems, the necessity to deploy multiple tightly-coupled components together often leads to overlooked or misconfigured environment variables, which manifest as configuration issues and deployment failures, thus indicating the underlying deployment coupling problem.
- [Manual Deployment Processes](manual-deployment-processes.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.376, Strength: 0.827">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The necessity to deploy multiple interdependent components together, even when only one has changed, leads to manual deployment processes, as teams must coordinate and verify each part, increasing the likelihood of human error and inconsistencies in the release.
- [Inadequate Configuration Management](inadequate-configuration-management.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.368, Strength: 0.810">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  When multiple components must be deployed together, inadequate tracking of versions can lead to incorrect configurations being used in deployments, causing errors and making it difficult to identify which changes are responsible for issues, thus highlighting the underlying problem of tightly coupled deployments.
- [Information Fragmentation](information-fragmentation.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.367, Strength: 0.878">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The necessity of deploying multiple components together creates a reliance on disparate documentation and knowledge sources, leading to scattered information that complicates maintenance and understanding of the system.
- [Vendor Lock-In](vendor-lock-in.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.365, Strength: 0.854">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The need to deploy multiple tightly-coupled components together often forces reliance on a specific vendor's tools or APIs, which can limit integration options and contribute to a lack of flexibility in future system updates or enhancements.
- [Communication Breakdown](communication-breakdown.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.363, Strength: 0.913">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  When multiple components must be deployed together, the lack of clear communication among team members can lead to misunderstandings about changes, resulting in duplicated efforts and misaligned solutions, highlighting the need for better coordination in the deployment process.
- [Code Duplication](code-duplication.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.337, Strength: 0.871">ⓘ</span>

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○
- **Deployment Process Mapping:** Map out the steps in the deployment process to identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement.
- **Component Dependency Analysis:** Analyze the dependencies between components to identify which components can be deployed independently.
- **Developer Surveys:** Ask developers if they feel like they are able to deploy their changes quickly and safely.

## Examples
A company has a large, monolithic e-commerce application. The application is composed of a number of different components, including a product catalog, a shopping cart, and a payment gateway. The components are all tightly coupled and deployed as a single unit. When the development team wants to make a change to the product catalog, they must redeploy the entire application. This is a time-consuming and risky process, and it often leads to problems. As a result, the company is only able to release new software once a month.
