## Description
Development disruption is a state where the development team is unable to focus on planned work due to a constant stream of interruptions. These interruptions can come from a variety of sources, such as production issues, urgent requests from stakeholders, or poorly defined requirements. When development is constantly disrupted, it is difficult for the team to make progress on its goals, and it can lead to a decline in both productivity and morale. This is a common problem in organizations that have a reactive, rather than a proactive, approach to software development.

## Indicators ⟡
- The team is constantly context-switching between different tasks.
- It is difficult for the team to get into a state of flow.
- The team is frequently missing its deadlines for planned work.
- There is a sense of frustration and chaos in the team's daily work.

## Symptoms ▲
- **[Slow Development Velocity](slow-development-velocity.md):** The team's ability to deliver new features is severely hampered by the constant interruptions.
- **[Increased Cognitive Load](increased-cognitive-load.md):** The need to constantly switch between different tasks can lead to mental fatigue and a decrease in cognitive performance.
- **[Developer Frustration and Burnout](developer-frustration-and-burnout.md):** The constant interruptions and lack of progress can be a major source of stress and frustration for developers.
- **[Lower Code Quality](lower-code-quality.md):** When developers are constantly being interrupted, they are more likely to make mistakes and produce lower-quality code.

## Root Causes ▼
- **[Constant Firefighting](constant-firefighting.md):** A high rate of production issues is a major source of development disruption.
- **Product Direction Chaos:** Without a strong product owner to shield the team from external interruptions, it is difficult for the team to stay focused on its goals.
- **Poorly Defined Requirements:** When requirements are not well-defined, it can lead to a lot of back-and-forth between the development team and stakeholders, which can be a major source of disruption.
- **[Unproductive Meetings](unproductive-meetings.md):** Poorly run or unnecessary meetings can be a major time sink and a source of disruption for the development team.
- **[Scope Creep](scope-creep.md):** When the scope of a project is constantly changing, it can be difficult for the team to make progress and can lead to a lot of wasted effort.

## Detection Methods ○
- **Interruption Rate:** Track the number of times that the development team is interrupted during the day.
- **Time in Flow:** Survey the team to find out how much time they are able to spend in a state of deep focus.
- **Task Switching Frequency:** Track how often developers have to switch between different tasks.
- **Planned vs. Unplanned Work:** Track the percentage of the team's time that is spent on planned versus unplanned work.

## Examples
A development team is working on a new feature for a web application. However, they are constantly being interrupted by requests from the marketing team to make small changes to the website. The team is also frequently pulled off of their work to fix production issues. As a result, the team is making very little progress on the new feature, and they are becoming increasingly frustrated. The constant interruptions are also leading to a decline in the quality of their work, and they are making more mistakes than usual.
