## Description
Development disruption is a state where the development team is unable to focus on planned work due to a constant stream of interruptions. These interruptions can come from a variety of sources, such as production issues, urgent requests from stakeholders, or poorly defined requirements. When development is constantly disrupted, it is difficult for the team to make progress on its goals, and it can lead to a decline in both productivity and morale. This is a common problem in organizations that have a reactive, rather than a proactive, approach to software development.


## Indicators ⟡
- The team is constantly context-switching between different tasks.
- It is difficult for the team to get into a state of flow.
- The team is frequently missing its deadlines for planned work.
- There is a sense of frustration and chaos in the team's daily work.


## Symptoms ▲

- [Frequent Changes to Requirements](frequent-changes-to-requirements.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.598, Strength: 0.829">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Constant interruptions from urgent production issues lead to incomplete understanding or alignment on project requirements, causing them to change frequently and resulting in rework and delays.
- [Legacy Skill Shortage](legacy-skill-shortage.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.552, Strength: 0.804">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The frequent need to address urgent production issues exacerbates the existing shortage of developers skilled in legacy technologies, as experienced personnel are diverted from planned projects, leading to increased reliance on a limited number of specialists and creating further disruptions in development.
- [Unreleased Resources](unreleased-resources.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.525, Strength: 0.810">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Frequent interruptions due to urgent production issues often lead developers to hastily allocate resources without proper management, resulting in unreleased resources as they prioritize immediate fixes over thorough cleanup and maintenance.
- [Developer Frustration and Burnout](developer-frustration-and-burnout.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.520, Strength: 0.721">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Constant interruptions from urgent production issues lead to incomplete tasks and mounting pressure, resulting in developers feeling overwhelmed and frustrated, which ultimately manifests as disengagement and burnout in the context of managing a legacy codebase.
- [Complex Domain Model](complex-domain-model.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.508, Strength: 0.715">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The frequent urgent production issues arise from the challenges in understanding and implementing the intricate software model, leading to development disruptions as the team spends excessive time addressing these complexities instead of focusing on planned tasks.
- [Flaky Tests](flaky-tests.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.488, Strength: 0.814">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Frequent interruptions from urgent production issues lead to rushed fixes that compromise the stability of the test environment, resulting in flaky tests that further erode developer confidence and disrupt workflow.
- [Increased Customer Support Load](increased-customer-support-load.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.485, Strength: 0.728">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Frequent interruptions in development due to urgent production issues lead to unresolved bugs and feature delays, causing users to struggle with the software and subsequently increase their contact with support for assistance.
- [Reduced Innovation](reduced-innovation.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.449, Strength: 0.914">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Constant interruptions from urgent production issues lead development teams to prioritize immediate fixes over long-term improvements, resulting in a focus on minimal compliance rather than fostering innovation.
- [Analysis Paralysis](analysis-paralysis.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.410, Strength: 0.821">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Constant interruptions from urgent production issues lead to a lack of focus, causing teams to overanalyze problems without reaching decisions, which in turn halts progress and exacerbates development delays in legacy systems.
- [Deadline Pressure](deadline-pressure.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.381, Strength: 0.801">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Frequent interruptions from urgent production issues force the development team to prioritize immediate fixes over planned tasks, creating a backlog that heightens pressure to meet deadlines, ultimately leading to rushed decisions and compromised quality in the software.
- [Project Authority Vacuum](project-authority-vacuum.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.364, Strength: 0.786">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Frequent urgent production issues divert the development team's focus and resources away from strategic projects, leading to a lack of organizational support and executive sponsorship needed to address and prioritize critical initiatives, thereby perpetuating the cycle of disruption.
- [Reduced Feature Quality](reduced-feature-quality.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.360, Strength: 0.877">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Frequent interruptions from urgent production issues force the development team to prioritize immediate fixes over comprehensive feature refinement, resulting in a decline in the quality of user experiences and functionality.
- [Stakeholder-Developer Communication Gap](stakeholder-developer-communication-gap.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.345, Strength: 0.759">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The frequent interruptions caused by urgent production issues prevent the development team from effectively aligning with stakeholder expectations, leading to miscommunication and resulting in rework that further hinders productivity in legacy systems.
- [Capacity Mismatch](capacity-mismatch.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.315, Strength: 0.756">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Frequent interruptions due to urgent production issues lead to inconsistent workflow and resource allocation, resulting in a misalignment of capacity across development stages that manifests as bottlenecks and underutilization.
- [Inadequate Test Data Management](inadequate-test-data-management.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.313, Strength: 0.785">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Frequent interruptions from urgent production issues prevent the team from adequately addressing test data management, resulting in unrealistic and outdated test scenarios that fail to prepare for real-world challenges.
- [High Defect Rate in Production](high-defect-rate-in-production.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.309, Strength: 0.721">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Frequent interruptions from urgent production issues hinder the team's ability to thoroughly test and fix defects during development, leading to a higher rate of bugs in the live environment as a direct consequence of inadequate quality assurance processes.
- [Inefficient Development Environment](inefficient-development-environment.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.302, Strength: 0.698">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Frequent urgent production issues force the development team to divert their attention from optimizing their slow and cumbersome environment, resulting in a cycle where inefficiencies are exacerbated by the constant need to react to disruptions rather than proactively improve the system.

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○
- **Interruption Rate:** Track the number of times that the development team is interrupted during the day.
- **Time in Flow:** Survey the team to find out how much time they are able to spend in a state of deep focus.
- **Task Switching Frequency:** Track how often developers have to switch between different tasks.
- **Planned vs. Unplanned Work:** Track the percentage of the team's time that is spent on planned versus unplanned work.


## Examples
A development team is working on a new feature for a web application. However, they are constantly being interrupted by requests from the marketing team to make small changes to the website. The team is also frequently pulled off of their work to fix production issues. As a result, the team is making very little progress on the new feature, and they are becoming increasingly frustrated. The constant interruptions are also leading to a decline in the quality of their work, and they are making more mistakes than usual.
