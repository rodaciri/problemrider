## Description
Difficult code comprehension is a situation where developers have a hard time understanding the codebase. This is a common problem in long-running projects, especially those that have been worked on by many different people over the years.

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○
- **Developer Surveys:** Ask developers if they find the codebase easy to read and understand.
- **Code Reviews:** Look for code that is difficult to understand and review.
- **Static Analysis Tools:** Use tools to identify code smells, such as complex code and long methods.


## Examples
A developer is trying to fix a bug in a legacy module. The developer finds that the module is very difficult to understand. The code is a mixture of different styles and conventions, and there is no documentation. The developer spends a lot of time trying to understand the code, and they are not able to fix the bug. This is a common problem in companies that do not have a culture of writing clean, readable code.
