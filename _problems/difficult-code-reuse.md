## Description
Difficult code reuse is a common problem in software development. It occurs when it is difficult to reuse code in different contexts because it is not designed in a modular and reusable way. This can lead to a number of problems, including code duplication, a high degree of coupling, and a system that is difficult to maintain and evolve. Difficult code reuse is often a sign of a lack of experience with software design principles and patterns.

## Indicators ⟡
- The codebase is full of duplicated code.
- The components of the system are tightly coupled.
- It is difficult to extract a component from the system and reuse it in another context.
- The team is constantly reinventing the wheel.

## Symptoms ▲
- [Legacy Skill Shortage](legacy-skill-shortage.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.665, Strength: 0.897">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The difficulty in reusing code due to its non-modular design leads to increased reliance on a limited pool of developers familiar with these legacy systems, creating a skill shortage that hinders effective maintenance and exacerbates the issue of code reuse.
- [Poor Test Coverage](poor-test-coverage.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.664, Strength: 0.881">ⓘ</span>

- [Inconsistent Behavior](inconsistent-behavior.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.355, Strength: 0.881">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The unpredictable outcomes of the business processes across different contexts create tightly coupled code dependencies, making it challenging to design modular components that can be easily reused.
- [Implicit Knowledge](implicit-knowledge.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.343, Strength: 0.708">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The presence of unwritten assumptions and undocumented practices leads to tightly coupled code that lacks clear interfaces and modularity, making it challenging to reuse in different contexts.
- [Deployment Coupling](deployment-coupling.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.330, Strength: 0.853">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The requirement for multiple components to be deployed together restricts the ability to isolate and modify individual pieces of code, leading to tightly coupled designs that hinder modularity and reusability across different contexts.
- [High Technical Debt](high-technical-debt.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.325, Strength: 0.865">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The accumulation of design and implementation shortcuts creates tightly coupled code that lacks modularity, making it difficult to adapt and reuse in different contexts.

## Detection Methods ○
- **Code Duplication Analysis:** Use static analysis tools to identify duplicated code.
- **Dependency Analysis:** Analyze the dependencies between the components of the system to identify areas of high coupling.
- **Code Reviews:** Code reviews are a great way to identify opportunities for code reuse.
- **Component Library Audit:** Audit the team's component library to see if it is being used effectively.

## Examples
A company has a number of different web applications. Each application has its own implementation of a user authentication system. This is an example of difficult code reuse. The problem could be solved by creating a single, reusable user authentication component that can be used by all of the company's web applications. This would reduce code duplication, improve maintainability, and make it easier to add new features to the user authentication system.
