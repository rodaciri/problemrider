## Description

Duplicated effort occurs when multiple team members work on the same problems, implement similar functionality, or research the same topics independently without realizing others are doing similar work. This represents wasted productivity and missed opportunities for collaboration, knowledge sharing, and more efficient resource utilization. Duplicated effort often indicates communication problems or inadequate coordination mechanisms within the team.


## Indicators ⟡

- Multiple team members discover they've been working on similar problems
- Similar code or solutions appear in different parts of the system
- Team members research the same topics independently
- Work assignments overlap without clear coordination
- Different team members reach different conclusions about the same technical questions

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○

- **Work Overlap Analysis:** Regularly review team assignments to identify potential overlaps
- **Code Similarity Detection:** Use tools to identify similar code implementations across the codebase
- **Research Topic Tracking:** Monitor what team members are researching and investigating
- **Sprint Planning Review:** Evaluate sprint plans for duplicated or overlapping work
- **Retrospective Feedback:** Ask team members about instances of duplicated effort they've encountered


## Examples

Two developers spend a week each implementing user authentication features for different parts of the application, not realizing they could share a common authentication service. When they compare their solutions during integration, they discover they've solved the same problems differently, requiring additional work to create a consistent approach. Another example involves three team members who independently research the best practices for implementing API rate limiting, each spending several hours reading documentation and testing different approaches. They reach different conclusions about the best solution, and the team must spend additional time reconciling their findings and agreeing on a single approach, tripling the research effort needed.
