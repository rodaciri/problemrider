## Description
Excessive class size is a code smell where a class has grown so large that it becomes difficult to manage. Large classes often accumulate too many responsibilities, violating the single responsibility principle. This complexity makes the code harder to read, test, and maintain, increasing the likelihood of bugs and slowing down development.


## Indicators ⟡
- Classes with high line counts (e.g., over 500 or 1000 lines).
- A single class that is frequently modified by multiple developers for different reasons.
- Difficulty in naming the class succinctly because it does too many things.
- The class has a large number of methods and instance variables.


## Symptoms ▲

- [Unbounded Data Structures](unbounded-data-structures.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.432, Strength: 0.673">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  When classes grow excessively large and complex, they often manage unbounded data structures, leading to uncontrolled memory usage and performance issues that indicate a lack of proper organization and maintenance in the codebase.
- [Complex Domain Model](complex-domain-model.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.397, Strength: 0.640">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  When classes become excessively large, they often attempt to encapsulate the complexities of the domain model, leading to convoluted logic and interdependencies that exacerbate the difficulties in understanding and implementing the system correctly.
- [Review Process Breakdown](review-process-breakdown.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.381, Strength: 0.588">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The complexity and size of classes overwhelm the review process, making it difficult for reviewers to effectively identify critical issues and provide constructive feedback, thereby indicating a breakdown in quality assurance practices within the legacy system.

## Root Causes ▼

- [Monitoring Gaps](monitoring-gaps.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.333, Strength: 0.932">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Insufficient monitoring and observability prevent timely detection of issues, allowing classes to grow excessively large and complex as developers add more functionality without addressing underlying problems, ultimately making the system harder to understand and maintain.
- [Procedural Background](procedural-background.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.302, Strength: 0.950">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The tendency to write procedural-style code within an object-oriented framework leads to the accumulation of excessive responsibilities and functionality within single classes, resulting in overly complex and unwieldy class structures that are difficult to maintain and test.

## Detection Methods ○
- **Code Metrics Tools:** Use static analysis tools to measure class size, cyclomatic complexity, and other metrics.
- **Code Reviews:** Regularly review code for large classes and classes with multiple responsibilities.
- **Responsibility Analysis:** Analyze the methods and properties of a class to determine if it has a single, well-defined responsibility.


## Examples
In a large e-commerce application, a class named `Product` starts by managing product information like name, price, and description. Over time, it's modified to also handle inventory management, supplier details, customer reviews, and discount calculations. The class grows to thousands of lines of code, and a change to the discount logic risks breaking inventory updates. This is a classic example of excessive class size, where a single class has become a "god object," making the entire system fragile and difficult to maintain.
