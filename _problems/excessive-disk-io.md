## Description
Excessive disk I/O can be a major cause of poor application performance. This can be caused by a variety of factors, from inefficient file access patterns and a lack of proper caching to a high volume of logging. When an application is I/O-bound, it can lead to a degradation in performance, timeouts, and even a complete failure of the system. A systematic approach to performance analysis is required to identify and address the root causes of excessive disk I/O.


## Indicators ⟡
- The disk activity light on your server is constantly blinking.
- The server's cooling fans are running at high speed, even when the CPU load is low.
- You see a high number of I/O operations in your system monitoring tools.
- Your application is slow, even though the CPU and memory usage are low.


## Symptoms ▲

- [Upstream Timeouts](upstream-timeouts.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.625, Strength: 0.803">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  High disk read/write operations can lead to increased response times for API calls, causing services to exceed their timeout thresholds and fail to receive timely responses.
- [Inefficient Development Environment](inefficient-development-environment.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.594, Strength: 0.868">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The slow and cumbersome development environment arises from excessive disk I/O, as inefficient data access leads to increased latency in file operations, hindering the team’s productivity and response times during development tasks.
- [Unreleased Resources](unreleased-resources.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.540, Strength: 0.840">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  High disk I/O can be exacerbated by unreleased resources, as lingering file handles and connections require repeated access to storage for data retrieval and processing, leading to inefficient data management and increased read/write operations.
- [Poor Caching Strategy](poor-caching-strategy.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.456, Strength: 0.804">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Inefficient data access caused by a lack of caching leads to repeated disk reads and writes for the same information, exacerbating excessive disk I/O and resulting in increased latency and resource consumption.
- [Queries That Prevent Index Usage](queries-that-prevent-index-usage.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.431, Strength: 0.768">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Inefficiently written queries can lead to the failure of the database to utilize available indexes, resulting in full-table scans that generate excessive disk read/write operations, thereby indicating a direct correlation between query optimization and disk I/O performance in legacy systems.
- [Interrupt Overhead](interrupt-overhead.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.393, Strength: 0.844">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The high frequency of disk read/write operations generates numerous hardware interrupts, which necessitate frequent context switches in the CPU, thereby serving as an indicator of underlying inefficiencies in data access and processing.
- [Deadline Pressure](deadline-pressure.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.388, Strength: 0.825">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Intense deadline pressure often leads to rushed development practices that overlook optimization, resulting in inefficient data handling that manifests as excessive disk I/O due to increased read/write operations and poor resource management.
- [Inadequate Test Data Management](inadequate-test-data-management.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.379, Strength: 0.856">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The reliance on unrealistic or outdated test data can lead to inefficient data access patterns that exacerbate excessive disk read/write operations, as the system struggles to process invalid inputs and scenarios not reflective of actual usage, thus highlighting the underlying inefficiencies in data handling.
- [Negative User Feedback](negative-user-feedback.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.373, Strength: 0.815">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The high frequency of disk read/write operations leads to delays in data retrieval and processing, which directly causes slow loading times and application freezes, resulting in user dissatisfaction with performance.
- [Unoptimized File Access](unoptimized-file-access.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.368, Strength: 0.891">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Inefficient file access methods increase the frequency and duration of disk read/write operations, serving as a clear indicator of the underlying issue of excessive disk I/O in legacy systems that rely on outdated data handling practices.
- [Memory Leaks](memory-leaks.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.333, Strength: 0.860">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Inefficient data access and processing can result in increased reliance on disk operations, causing applications to hold onto memory longer than necessary, which manifests as gradual memory consumption and contributes to performance degradation.
- [Inefficient Database Indexing](inefficient-database-indexing.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.325, Strength: 0.828">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The high frequency of disk read/write operations is exacerbated by the lack of appropriate indexing, which forces the system to perform inefficient full-table scans instead of utilizing quick lookups, leading to increased I/O activity and degraded performance.
- [High Defect Rate in Production](high-defect-rate-in-production.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.323, Strength: 0.764">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Excessive disk I/O can lead to performance bottlenecks that hinder the timely execution of tests and deployment processes, causing undetected issues to accumulate and result in a high number of bugs in the live environment post-release.

## Detection Methods ○

- **System Monitoring Tools:** Use tools like `iostat`, `vmstat`, `sar` (Linux) or Performance Monitor (Windows) to track disk I/O metrics (e.g., read/write operations per second, average queue length, I/O wait time).
- **Database Monitoring Tools:** Database-specific tools often provide metrics on disk I/O related to database operations.
- **Application Profiling:** Profile the application to identify code sections that are performing excessive disk operations.
- **Log Analysis:** Analyze log volumes and patterns to see if excessive logging is occurring.


## Examples
A data processing service is designed to read large CSV files, process them, and write the results to another file. During execution, the server's disk I/O goes to 100%, and the process takes hours. Investigation reveals that the service is reading and writing data one line at a time, causing thousands of small, inefficient disk operations. Similarly, a web server experiencing slow page loads might have high disk I/O, even with a separate database server, if it's constantly writing session data to local disk files for every request instead of using an in-memory cache.
