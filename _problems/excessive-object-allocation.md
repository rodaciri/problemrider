## Description

Excessive object allocation occurs when code creates an unnecessarily large number of temporary objects, particularly in frequently executed code paths. This puts pressure on the garbage collector, increases memory usage, and can significantly degrade application performance. While object creation is normal in object-oriented programming, excessive allocation in hot paths can cause performance problems that worsen as the application scales or processes more data.

## Indicators ⟡
- Garbage collection occurs frequently and consumes significant CPU time
- Memory usage spikes during normal operation even without memory leaks
- Application performance degrades during periods of high activity
- Profiling shows high object allocation rates in specific code areas
- Performance improves significantly when object pooling or reuse is implemented

## Symptoms ▲
- [Unbounded Data Structures](unbounded-data-structures.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.488, Strength: 0.732">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The creation of numerous temporary objects leads to unbounded data structures that accumulate without proper management, causing increased memory usage and exacerbating the performance issues associated with frequent garbage collection in legacy systems.
- [Unreleased Resources](unreleased-resources.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.394, Strength: 0.662">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The creation of numerous temporary objects without proper deallocation leads to unreleased resources, as the persistent demand for memory and system handles exacerbates the pressure on the garbage collector, ultimately resulting in degraded performance in legacy systems.
- [Poor Caching Strategy](poor-caching-strategy.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.373, Strength: 0.661">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Inefficient caching practices lead to repeated object instantiation for the same data on each request, resulting in excessive temporary object allocation that burdens the garbage collector and impairs system performance.
- [Review Process Breakdown](review-process-breakdown.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.309, Strength: 0.609">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The failure of code review practices to identify and rectify excessive temporary object creation indicates a lack of thorough analysis and attention to performance implications, allowing inefficient coding patterns to persist and degrade system performance over time.

## Root Causes ▼
- [High Technical Debt](high-technical-debt.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.314, Strength: 0.864">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Design and implementation shortcuts result in inefficient code that frequently generates temporary objects, leading to excessive allocations and increased pressure on the garbage collector, ultimately degrading system performance.
- [Long-Running Transactions](long-running-transactions.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.307, Strength: 0.891">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Long-running transactions hold resources and locks, which can lead to higher memory pressure as the system attempts to manage concurrent operations, resulting in the creation of excessive temporary objects that burden the garbage collector and degrade overall performance.

## Detection Methods ○
- **Memory Profiling:** Use profiling tools to identify code areas with high object allocation rates
- **Garbage Collection Monitoring:** Track GC frequency, duration, and memory pressure metrics
- **Allocation Rate Analysis:** Measure object creation rates in different parts of the application
- **Performance Testing:** Load testing that reveals allocation-related performance issues
- **Code Review Focus:** Specifically examine code for unnecessary object creation patterns

## Examples

A data processing application reads CSV files and processes each row by creating a new `DataRecord` object, then converting each field to appropriate types by creating additional temporary objects for validation and transformation. For a file with 1 million rows and 20 columns, this creates over 20 million temporary objects within a single processing operation. The excessive allocation causes the garbage collector to run continuously, consuming 60% of CPU time and making the processing 10 times slower than necessary. Refactoring to reuse objects and use primitive types where possible reduces processing time from 10 minutes to 1 minute. Another example involves a web application that builds JSON responses by repeatedly concatenating strings in a loop, creating thousands of temporary string objects for each API response. During high traffic periods, the server spends more time in garbage collection than processing actual requests. Users experience slow response times and the server requires more memory and CPU resources than similar applications. Switching to a StringBuilder or streaming JSON writer eliminates the performance problem and reduces server resource requirements by 70%.
