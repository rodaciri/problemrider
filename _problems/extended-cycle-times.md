## Description

Extended cycle times occur when the total time from work initiation to completion is significantly longer than the actual time spent working on the task. This indicates that work spends more time waiting in queues, blocked by dependencies, or stalled in processes than being actively worked on. Extended cycle times reduce responsiveness to business needs and indicate inefficiencies in the development process.


## Indicators ⟡

- Total time from task start to completion is many times longer than actual work time
- Work items spend more time "in progress" than being actively worked on
- Tasks remain in the same status for extended periods without progress
- Small changes take weeks or months to complete despite requiring hours of work
- Team can identify significant waiting periods in their work process


## Symptoms ▲

- [Reduced Team Productivity](reduced-team-productivity.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.599, Strength: 0.881">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Extended cycle times lead to reduced team productivity as prolonged delivery timelines create frustration and burnout among developers, hindering their efficiency and focus on tasks.
- [Inefficient Development Environment](inefficient-development-environment.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.504, Strength: 0.773">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The prolonged cycle times stem from a slow and cumbersome development environment, where inefficient tools and processes hinder productivity, causing delays that extend the overall project timeline beyond the actual time needed for work completion.
- [Frequent Changes to Requirements](frequent-changes-to-requirements.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.492, Strength: 0.720">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Constantly updated requirements during development reflect a lack of clarity and stability, often stemming from prolonged cycle times that create uncertainty, prompting stakeholders to adjust expectations and resulting in increased rework and delays.
- [Upstream Timeouts](upstream-timeouts.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.457, Strength: 0.665">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Extended cycle times lead to delayed processing and response generation, causing services that rely on timely API responses to experience timeouts as they exceed their configured waiting periods.
- [Reduced Individual Productivity](reduced-individual-productivity.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.454, Strength: 0.828">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Extended cycle times often lead to reduced individual productivity as developers become bogged down by inefficiencies in outdated processes, tools, and communication breakdowns, causing delays that extend the time taken to complete tasks despite their consistent effort.
- [Interrupt Overhead](interrupt-overhead.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.440, Strength: 0.808">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Excessive hardware interrupts lead to frequent context switches that disrupt CPU execution flow, resulting in delays that extend the overall time to complete and deliver work, thereby indicating inefficiencies in the system's processing capability.
- [Increased Manual Work](increased-manual-work.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.429, Strength: 0.779">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The need for repetitive manual tasks in legacy systems, often due to outdated processes and a lack of automation, directly prolongs project timelines by diverting developers' attention from essential development work, thereby extending overall cycle times.
- [Slow Development Velocity](slow-development-velocity.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.406, Strength: 0.740">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The prolonged time from project initiation to delivery, often caused by inefficient processes and outdated technologies, leads to a decrease in the team's ability to consistently deliver features and fixes, thereby manifesting as a predictable decline in overall development productivity.
- [Poor Project Control](poor-project-control.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.370, Strength: 0.783">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Ineffective monitoring of project progress in legacy systems leads to undetected delays and inefficiencies, resulting in extended delivery times that hinder timely adjustments and recovery efforts.
- [Analysis Paralysis](analysis-paralysis.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.343, Strength: 0.707">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Extended cycle times often stem from teams getting bogged down in excessive research and deliberation, resulting in analysis paralysis that hinders timely implementation and prolongs delivery timelines in legacy systems.
- [Product Direction Chaos](product-direction-chaos.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.322, Strength: 0.710">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Conflicting priorities from multiple stakeholders lead to indecision and delays in the development process, resulting in prolonged cycle times as teams struggle to align their efforts and execute efficiently within the constraints of legacy systems.
- [Reduced Feature Quality](reduced-feature-quality.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.321, Strength: 0.780">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Longer cycle times reduce the available time for testing and refinement, leading to rushed deployments that compromise the quality of features delivered in legacy systems.
- [Inappropriate Skillset](inappropriate-skillset.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.307, Strength: 0.816">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The prolonged time to complete and deliver work often arises from team members struggling to perform their duties effectively, as they lack the necessary skills and experience, leading to inefficiencies that extend project timelines.

## Detection Methods ○

- **Cycle Time Measurement:** Track total time from work start to completion
- **Flow Efficiency Analysis:** Calculate ratio of work time to total cycle time
- **Wait Time Tracking:** Identify how much time tasks spend waiting versus being worked on
- **Process Step Analysis:** Measure time spent at each stage of the development process
- **Comparative Analysis:** Compare cycle times for similar work items to identify patterns


## Examples

A simple bug fix that requires 2 hours of development time takes 6 weeks to reach production due to extended code review queues, deployment approval processes, and monthly release cycles. The actual work is completed quickly, but the fix spends most of its time waiting in various queues and approval processes. Another example involves a feature request that takes 3 months from approval to delivery, despite only requiring 1 week of actual development work. The extended cycle time is caused by waiting for design approval, development queue backlogs, testing bottlenecks, and deployment scheduling constraints.
