## Description
External service delays are a common problem in distributed systems, where services often depend on third-party APIs to fulfill requests. When an external service is slow to respond, it can have a cascading effect, causing delays in downstream services and a poor user experience. External service delays can be caused by a variety of factors, from network issues and a lack of proper caching to a problem with the third-party service itself. A robust monitoring and alerting system is essential for detecting and responding to external service delays in a timely manner.

## Indicators ⟡
- Your application is slow, but your servers are not under heavy load.
- You see a high number of timeout errors in your logs.
- Your application's performance is inconsistent.
- You are getting complaints from users about slow performance.

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○

- **Distributed Tracing:** Use distributed tracing to follow a request from the API to the external service and identify where the time is being spent.
- **Metrics and Alerting:** Monitor the latency of calls to the external service. Set up alerts for when the latency exceeds a certain threshold.
- **Status Pages:** Check the status page of the external service to see if they are reporting any issues.
- **Service Level Agreements (SLAs):** If there is an SLA in place for the external service, monitor the service's performance against the SLA.

## Examples
An e-commerce application uses a third-party service to process payments. The payment service is slow, which causes the checkout process to be slow. In a microservice architecture, a single slow service can cause a cascading failure that affects the entire application. This is a common problem in modern applications, which are often built by composing together a variety of different services. While this approach has many benefits, it also introduces new challenges, such as the need to deal with external service delays.
