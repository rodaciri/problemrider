## Description

Fear of change is a psychological and practical barrier that prevents developers from modifying existing code. This fear stems from legitimate concerns about introducing bugs, breaking functionality, or causing system instability. When developers consistently avoid making necessary changes or improvements due to these concerns, it indicates deeper systemic issues with code quality, testing practices, and system architecture. This fear can become self-reinforcing, as avoided changes accumulate technical debt, making future modifications even riskier.

## Indicators ⟡
- Developers express reluctance or anxiety when asked to modify certain parts of the system
- Estimates for seemingly simple changes are inflated due to perceived risk
- The team frequently chooses workarounds rather than addressing root causes
- Discussions about code changes focus more on what might break than on the benefits of the change
- New features are implemented as additions rather than improvements to existing code

## Symptoms ▲
- [Frequent Changes to Requirements](frequent-changes-to-requirements.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.463, Strength: 0.700">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The hesitation to modify existing code increases the likelihood of frequent requirement changes, as developers seek to avoid potential disruptions, leading to ongoing project adjustments and rework that exacerbate their fear of making necessary updates.
- [Developer Frustration and Burnout](developer-frustration-and-burnout.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.423, Strength: 0.665">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The hesitance to modify existing code due to the perceived risks leads to a stagnant work environment, causing developers to feel demotivated and exhausted as they grapple with unresolved issues, ultimately resulting in frustration and burnout.
- [Slow Development Velocity](slow-development-velocity.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.417, Strength: 0.766">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The developers' reluctance to modify existing code due to the fear of unintended consequences leads to prolonged decision-making and avoidance of necessary changes, resulting in a significant slowdown in the team's ability to deliver features and fixes in a timely manner.
- [Reduced Team Productivity](reduced-team-productivity.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.414, Strength: 0.734">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Hesitance to modify existing code leads to a culture of risk aversion, resulting in fewer code updates and enhancements, which in turn causes systemic inefficiencies and a decline in the overall output and effectiveness of the development team.
- [Legacy Skill Shortage](legacy-skill-shortage.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.411, Strength: 0.681">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The reluctance to modify legacy code due to the fear of introducing errors leads to a reliance on a diminishing pool of developers familiar with outdated technologies, creating maintenance bottlenecks and increasing the risk of failure in system support.
- [Inefficient Development Environment](inefficient-development-environment.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.394, Strength: 0.675">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The developers' fear of modifying the legacy code leads to reliance on an inefficient and cumbersome development environment, which further exacerbates their hesitation to implement changes, creating a cycle of reduced productivity and increased risk aversion.
- [Analysis Paralysis](analysis-paralysis.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.332, Strength: 0.690">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The hesitation to modify existing code due to the fear of unintended consequences leads to excessive research and deliberation, causing teams to become immobilized in the planning phase instead of advancing to implementation.
- [Review Process Breakdown](review-process-breakdown.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.314, Strength: 0.632">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The reluctance to modify legacy code stems from a fear of introducing errors, which in turn leads to a breakdown in the review process, as developers avoid thorough scrutiny and constructive feedback to mitigate perceived risks, ultimately resulting in lower code quality and increased technical debt.

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○
- **Developer Surveys:** Ask team members about their confidence level when making changes to different parts of the system
- **Change Frequency Analysis:** Monitor how often different modules are modified; consistently avoided areas may indicate fear
- **Estimation Patterns:** Look for patterns where similar changes have wildly different estimates based on the code area involved
- **Code Review Comments:** Watch for excessive caution or lengthy discussions about potential risks during code reviews
- **Retrospective Feedback:** Listen for concerns about code stability and change difficulty during team retrospectives

## Examples

A team needs to update a business rule in their order processing system. The change itself is conceptually simple—adjusting a discount calculation—but the function handling discounts also manages inventory updates, sends email notifications, and logs analytics events. The developer assigned to make the change estimates two weeks instead of two hours because they're afraid that modifying the discount logic will inadvertently break the email system or cause inventory discrepancies. This fear is justified given the tight coupling, but it prevents the team from making necessary business changes efficiently. Eventually, they implement the discount change as a separate function with duplicated logic rather than fixing the original problematic function.
