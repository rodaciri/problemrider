## Description

Feature gaps occur when software is delivered without functionality that users consider essential, typically because developers or product teams made incorrect assumptions about user needs without proper validation. These gaps often emerge when development teams work in isolation from actual users, rely on incomplete requirements, or make decisions based on their own technical perspective rather than user workflows and business needs.

## Indicators ⟡

- Users frequently request functionality that seems basic or obvious in hindsight
- Workarounds or manual processes are required to complete common user tasks
- Users abandon the software in favor of alternatives that provide missing functionality
- Customer support receives repeated requests for the same missing features
- User adoption is slower than expected due to incomplete functionality

## Symptoms ▲

- **[User Frustration](user-frustration.md):** Users become frustrated when they cannot complete their intended tasks
- **[Competitive Disadvantage](competitive-disadvantage.md):** Competitors offer functionality that your product lacks
- **[Customer Dissatisfaction](customer-dissatisfaction.md):** Users don't adopt the software because it doesn't meet their needs
- **[Increased Customer Support Load](increased-customer-support-load.md):** Support team handles requests for missing functionality
- **[Implementation Rework](implementation-rework.md):** Major development effort required to add missing core functionality
- **Market Share Loss:** Users choose alternative solutions that provide complete functionality

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Assumption-Based Development](assumption-based-development.md):** Developers build based on assumptions rather than validated user requirements
- **[Inadequate Requirements Gathering](inadequate-requirements-gathering.md):** Insufficient research into actual user needs and workflows
- **Stakeholder Unavailability:** Key stakeholders aren't available to clarify requirements and user needs
- **Developer Overconfidence:** Development team believes they understand user needs without validation
- **Limited User Research:** No systematic process for understanding user workflows and pain points
- **Technical Bias:** Focusing on technically interesting problems rather than user-valuable features
- **MVP Misinterpretation:** Confusing "minimum viable" with "incomplete" or "basic"

## Detection Methods ○

- **User Feedback Analysis:** Systematic collection and analysis of user requests and complaints
- **Competitive Feature Analysis:** Compare your product's functionality with successful competitors
- **User Journey Mapping:** Map complete user workflows to identify where functionality is missing
- **Usage Analytics:** Monitor where users drop off or struggle in their workflows
- **Customer Interview Programs:** Regular interviews with users about their needs and pain points
- **Feature Request Tracking:** Monitor volume and patterns of feature requests

## Examples

A project management tool is built with task creation and assignment features but lacks time tracking, file attachment, or progress reporting capabilities. Users must use separate tools for these functions, making the project management tool incomplete for actual project workflows. Teams abandon the tool for competitors that provide integrated functionality. Another example involves an e-commerce platform that handles product listings and basic ordering but lacks inventory management, shipping integration, or customer communication features. Store owners must cobble together multiple systems to run their business, creating complexity and data synchronization issues that could have been avoided with more complete functionality.
