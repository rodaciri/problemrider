## Description

Flaky tests are automated tests that produce inconsistent results when run multiple times against the same code, sometimes passing and sometimes failing without any changes to the codebase. These tests undermine confidence in the entire test suite, making it difficult to distinguish between real regressions and false positives. Over time, teams begin to ignore test failures or disable flaky tests, reducing the effectiveness of automated testing as a safety net for code changes.


## Indicators ⟡

- Tests that occasionally fail on continuous integration but pass when run locally
- Team members regularly re-running failed test suites to see if they pass the second time
- Tests that fail more frequently during high system load or specific times of day
- Intermittent test failures that are difficult to reproduce consistently
- Tests that depend on external services or network connectivity
- Test setup or teardown processes that don't consistently reset system state
- Tests with hard-coded timing assumptions or sleep statements

## Detection Methods ○

- Track test failure rates and patterns over time to identify inconsistent tests
- Run test suites multiple times in succession to identify non-deterministic behavior
- Monitor CI/CD pipeline metrics for tests that fail and then pass without code changes
- Use test flakiness detection tools that analyze historical test results
- Implement test quarantine systems that flag unreliable tests
- Review test code for timing dependencies, external service calls, and shared state
- Analyze test failures by time of day, system load, or environmental factors


## Examples

A web application's test suite includes an integration test that verifies user registration functionality. The test creates a user account, sends a verification email, and checks that the account becomes active. However, the test sometimes fails because it doesn't wait long enough for the email service to process the request before checking the account status. On fast test environments, the test passes, but on slower systems or during high load, the email processing takes longer and the test fails. The team initially ignores these failures as "environment issues," but over time, more tests develop similar timing problems. Eventually, the team loses confidence in the test suite and begins relying more heavily on manual testing, missing several real bugs that automated tests could have caught.
