## Description

Garbage collection pressure occurs when applications create and discard objects at such a high rate that the garbage collector must run frequently to reclaim memory, causing noticeable performance pauses and reduced overall throughput. This problem is particularly severe in applications with high allocation rates, large object graphs, or inappropriate object lifetime patterns that stress the garbage collection system.

## Indicators ⟡

- Frequent garbage collection cycles interrupt application execution
- GC pause times increase over application lifetime
- High allocation rates shown in memory profiling
- Application throughput decreases due to GC overhead
- Memory usage patterns show rapid allocation and collection cycles

## Symptoms ▲
- [Increased Customer Support Load](increased-customer-support-load.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.325, Strength: 0.566">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Frequent performance pauses caused by excessive garbage collection lead to user frustration and task completion issues, resulting in an increased volume of customer support inquiries.

## Root Causes ▼
- [Deadlock Conditions](deadlock-conditions.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.356, Strength: 0.862">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  When multiple threads become deadlocked and cannot release resources, it leads to an accumulation of uncollectible objects in memory, which increases allocation rates and triggers more frequent garbage collection cycles, ultimately degrading performance and throughput in legacy systems.
- [High Number of Database Queries](high-number-of-database-queries.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.343, Strength: 0.865">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The excessive number of database queries generates a high volume of transient objects that are quickly allocated and deallocated, leading to increased garbage collection cycles that disrupt application performance and throughput.
- [Constantly Shifting Deadlines](constantly-shifting-deadlines.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.325, Strength: 0.908">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Frequent changes in project scope lead to rushed implementations and increased object creation, resulting in excessive allocation and deallocation that intensifies garbage collection cycles and hampers application performance.
- [Task Queues Backing Up](task-queues-backing-up.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.319, Strength: 0.846">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The accumulation of unprocessed asynchronous jobs leads to increased object retention in memory, causing excessive allocation and deallocation cycles that trigger frequent garbage collection events and degrade overall application performance.
- [High Technical Debt](high-technical-debt.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.300, Strength: 0.855">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Design and implementation shortcuts often lead to inefficient memory management and excessive object creation, which in turn results in increased garbage collection frequency and performance degradation.

## Detection Methods ○

- **GC Logging:** Enable garbage collector logging to analyze collection frequency and duration
- **Memory Profiling:** Use profilers to track object allocation rates and garbage collection impact
- **Application Performance Monitoring:** Monitor throughput and response time correlations with GC activity
- **Heap Analysis:** Analyze heap dumps to identify object allocation patterns and lifetimes
- **GC Tuning Metrics:** Monitor GC-specific metrics like collection time percentage and pause duration
- **Allocation Profiling:** Profile object allocation hot paths and patterns

## Examples

A web service processes JSON requests by parsing them into object graphs, processing the data, and serializing responses. The parsing creates thousands of temporary objects per request, and under high load, the garbage collector runs every few seconds, causing 100-200ms pauses that make the API unresponsive. The application's throughput drops by 40% due to time spent in garbage collection rather than request processing. Another example involves a data analytics application that processes large datasets by creating intermediate collection objects for each data transformation step. The application creates millions of temporary list and map objects, causing the garbage collector to run almost continuously and making data processing take 10x longer than necessary due to constant memory management overhead.
