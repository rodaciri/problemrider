## Description

The God Object anti-pattern occurs when single classes or components accumulate too many responsibilities and become overly complex, often handling multiple unrelated concerns within a single unit. These objects become difficult to understand, maintain, test, and modify because they violate the single responsibility principle and create bottlenecks for development and maintenance.

## Indicators ⟡

- Classes with hundreds or thousands of lines of code
- Single objects handling multiple unrelated business concerns
- Methods that perform many different types of operations
- Classes that are difficult to name because they do too many things
- Components that multiple teams need to modify for different reasons

## Symptoms ▲
- [Legacy Skill Shortage](legacy-skill-shortage.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.558, Strength: 0.783">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The complexity and interdependency created by overly centralized classes make it difficult for developers unfamiliar with legacy technologies to navigate the codebase, resulting in a reliance on a limited number of skilled individuals who can manage the system, thus highlighting the critical shortage of expertise as a symptom of the underlying architectural issues.
- [Complex Domain Model](complex-domain-model.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.516, Strength: 0.751">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  When a single class or component accumulates excessive responsibilities, it often leads to a convoluted representation of the complex business domain, making it challenging to implement and understand, thereby indicating underlying architectural flaws.
- [Technical Architecture Limitations](technical-architecture-limitations.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.434, Strength: 0.808">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  When a single class or component takes on excessive responsibilities, it often leads to architectural constraints that hinder performance and scalability, as the complexity of the codebase makes it difficult to implement efficient, modular solutions.
- [Inconsistent Naming Conventions](inconsistent-naming-conventions.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.408, Strength: 0.788">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  When a single class or component accumulates excessive responsibilities, it often leads to a chaotic and unstructured codebase where naming conventions become inconsistent, making it difficult for developers to understand and navigate the code effectively.
- [Inadequate Test Data Management](inadequate-test-data-management.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.339, Strength: 0.834">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The excessive complexity and intertwined responsibilities of a single component often lead to inadequate test data management, as developers struggle to create realistic test scenarios that encompass all functionality, ultimately resulting in tests that fail to reflect real-world usage.
- [Inefficient Code](inefficient-code.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.337, Strength: 0.796">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  When a single class or component takes on too many responsibilities, it often leads to convoluted logic and interdependencies, resulting in inefficient code that suffers from performance bottlenecks due to the excessive complexity of handling requests.
- [Monolithic Architecture Constraints](monolithic-architecture-constraints.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.302, Strength: 0.729">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  When a single class or component takes on excessive responsibilities, it leads to a bloated codebase that hinders modularization, ultimately resulting in a monolithic structure that is challenging to maintain, scale, and deploy.

## Root Causes ▼
- [Shared Dependencies](shared-dependencies.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.302, Strength: 0.954">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Shared dependencies lead to tightly coupled components that force a single class to manage multiple responsibilities, resulting in increased complexity and making it difficult to isolate and test individual functionalities.

## Detection Methods ○

- **Code Metrics Analysis:** Monitor class size, method count, and complexity metrics
- **Responsibility Analysis:** Review what different methods and properties in classes do
- **Change Impact Analysis:** Track how often and why large objects are modified
- **Testing Coverage Analysis:** Identify objects that are difficult to test comprehensively
- **Team Collaboration Metrics:** Monitor how often multiple developers modify same objects

## Examples

An e-commerce application has a `OrderManager` class that handles order creation, payment processing, inventory updates, shipping calculations, tax calculations, customer notifications, order status tracking, refund processing, and reporting. The class has over 2,000 lines of code and 50+ methods. When the tax calculation logic needs to change, developers risk breaking payment processing. When inventory management needs updates, it affects shipping calculations. The class is so complex that comprehensive testing requires setting up databases, payment processors, shipping services, and email systems, making unit testing nearly impossible. Another example involves a user management system with a `User` class that handles authentication, authorization, profile management, preferences, notification settings, activity tracking, friend relationships, content creation, and reporting. Any change to user preferences affects authentication code, and changes to friend relationships can break content creation features, making the system fragile and difficult to maintain.
