## Description
Gold plating is the practice of adding unnecessary features or complexity to a project. This is often done by developers who believe that it will impress the stakeholders. However, gold plating can lead to a number of problems, including scope creep, feature creep, and a bloated and unfocused product. Gold plating is a common problem in software development, and it can be difficult to avoid.

## Indicators ⟡
- The team is adding features that were not requested.
- The team is spending a lot of time on features that are not essential.
- The product is becoming more and more complex over time.
- The team is not focused on the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

## Symptoms ▲
- **[Scope Creep](scope-creep.md):** The project's scope is constantly expanding.
- **[Feature Creep](feature-creep.md):** The product is becoming bloated and unfocused.
- **[Increased Cost of Development](increased-cost-of-development.md):** The cost of developing and maintaining the system is inflated due to the extra work being done.
- **[Slow Development Velocity](slow-development-velocity.md):** It takes a long time to develop and release new features.

## Root Causes ▼
- **[Eager to Please Stakeholders](eager-to-please-stakeholders.md):** Developers may believe that adding extra features will impress the stakeholders.
- **[Unclear Goals and Priorities](unclear-goals-and-priorities.md):** Without a clear product vision, it is difficult to say no to new feature requests.
- **[Product Direction Chaos](product-direction-chaos.md):** A weak product owner may be unable to resist pressure from developers to add new features.
- **[Unclear Goals and Priorities](unclear-goals-and-priorities.md):** When there is no clear definition of what it means for a feature to be done, it can be difficult to know when to stop working on it.

## Detection Methods ○
- **Feature Request Backlog:** Analyze the feature request backlog to identify features that were not requested.
- **Product Roadmap:** Review the product roadmap to see if it is focused and realistic.
- **User Feedback:** Listen to user feedback to see if they are finding the system to be complex and confusing.
- **Code Complexity Metrics:** Use static analysis tools to measure the complexity of the codebase.

## Examples
A team is building a new website. The team decides to add a number of features that were not requested by the stakeholders. The team believes that these features will impress the stakeholders. However, the features are not essential, and they add a lot of complexity to the website. The website is delivered late and over budget. The stakeholders are not impressed.
