## Description
Gold plating is the practice of adding unnecessary features or complexity to a project. This is often done by developers who believe that it will impress the stakeholders. However, gold plating can lead to a number of problems, including scope creep, feature creep, and a bloated and unfocused product. Gold plating is a common problem in software development, and it can be difficult to avoid.


## Indicators ⟡
- The team is adding features that were not requested.
- The team is spending a lot of time on features that are not essential.
- The product is becoming more and more complex over time.
- The team is not focused on the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

## Root Causes ▼

- [Poor Encapsulation](poor-encapsulation.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.377, Strength: 0.903">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  When data and behavior are poorly encapsulated, developers may feel compelled to add unnecessary features to compensate for unclear requirements and interdependencies, leading to an escalation of complexity and scope beyond what was initially intended.
- [Procedural Background](procedural-background.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.370, Strength: 0.941">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Developers accustomed to procedural programming may inadvertently introduce unnecessary features due to their misunderstanding of object-oriented principles, leading them to overcomplicate designs in an attempt to showcase their skills rather than adhering to project requirements.
- [Technology Lock-In](technology-lock-in.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.352, Strength: 0.827">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The difficulty in transitioning away from entrenched technologies leads developers to believe that adding unnecessary features will justify the existing system's complexity, ultimately resulting in excessive modifications to impress stakeholders rather than addressing core requirements.
- [Monitoring Gaps](monitoring-gaps.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.343, Strength: 0.878">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Insufficient monitoring and observability in legacy systems can prevent developers from understanding the actual needs and performance issues of the application, leading them to introduce unnecessary features in an attempt to enhance functionality without clear justification.
- [Perfectionist Culture](perfectionist-culture.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.324, Strength: 0.871">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  A culture that emphasizes flawless outcomes often pressures developers to enhance projects with unnecessary features in an attempt to meet unrealistic perfection standards, resulting in gold plating as they strive to impress stakeholders rather than adhere to the original project scope.

## Detection Methods ○
- **Feature Request Backlog:** Analyze the feature request backlog to identify features that were not requested.
- **Product Roadmap:** Review the product roadmap to see if it is focused and realistic.
- **User Feedback:** Listen to user feedback to see if they are finding the system to be complex and confusing.
- **Code Complexity Metrics:** Use static analysis tools to measure the complexity of the codebase.


## Examples
A team is building a new website. The team decides to add a number of features that were not requested by the stakeholders. The team believes that these features will impress the stakeholders. However, the features are not essential, and they add a lot of complexity to the website. The website is delivered late and over budget. The stakeholders are not impressed.
