## Description

GraphQL complexity issues occur when queries become too expensive to execute due to deep nesting, large result sets, or computationally intensive resolvers. Without proper query complexity analysis and limits, GraphQL's flexibility can be exploited to create queries that consume excessive server resources, leading to performance degradation or denial-of-service conditions.


## Indicators ⟡

- GraphQL queries taking significantly longer to execute than expected
- Server resources consumed disproportionately by certain queries
- Memory usage spikes during GraphQL query execution
- Database queries generated from GraphQL becoming inefficient
- Client applications able to overload server with complex queries


## Symptoms ▲

- [Upstream Timeouts](upstream-timeouts.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.553, Strength: 0.739">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Excessive complexity in query execution can lead to prolonged processing times, causing downstream services to exceed their timeout thresholds and fail to receive timely responses.
- [Complex Domain Model](complex-domain-model.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.522, Strength: 0.737">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The inherent complexity of the business domain leads to intricate GraphQL queries that are difficult to optimize, resulting in performance issues and increasing the risk of denial-of-service vulnerabilities.
- [Queries That Prevent Index Usage](queries-that-prevent-index-usage.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.363, Strength: 0.670">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Complex and expensive queries in GraphQL often lead to inefficient query structures that can bypass index usage, resulting in slower performance and highlighting potential vulnerabilities in legacy systems.
- [Unbounded Data Structures](unbounded-data-structures.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.345, Strength: 0.791">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Excessively complex queries can generate unbounded data structures by requesting large volumes of nested and interconnected data without constraints, leading to memory exhaustion and performance degradation in legacy systems.

## Detection Methods ○

- **Query Complexity Monitoring:** Monitor computational cost and resource usage of GraphQL queries
- **Resolver Performance Profiling:** Profile individual resolver execution times and resource usage
- **Database Query Analysis:** Analyze database queries generated by GraphQL execution
- **Query Depth and Breadth Analysis:** Track query structure complexity metrics
- **Resource Usage Correlation:** Correlate query patterns with server resource consumption


## Examples

An e-commerce GraphQL API allows clients to query product information with unlimited depth, enabling queries that fetch products with their categories, related products, reviews, and reviewer profiles recursively. A malicious or poorly designed client creates a query 10 levels deep that retrieves 50,000+ database records and consumes 2GB of memory, effectively creating a denial-of-service condition. Implementing query complexity analysis with depth limits and result pagination prevents resource exhaustion while maintaining API flexibility. Another example involves a social media GraphQL API where the friends resolver doesn't implement proper batching, causing N+1 query problems. A query fetching 100 users and their friends list generates 101 database queries instead of 2, making response times unacceptable. Implementing DataLoader for batch fetching reduces database queries by 98% and improves response times from 5 seconds to 200ms.
