## Description
A high defect rate in production is a clear sign that there are serious problems with the quality of a product. This can be caused by a variety of factors, from insufficient testing and inadequate code reviews to a lack of a proper release process. When a product is not thoroughly tested, it is likely to have a high number of bugs, which can lead to a poor user experience, a loss of trust, and a significant amount of rework. A comprehensive testing strategy should include a mix of automated and manual testing, and it should be integrated into the development process from the very beginning. Investing in testing is an investment in the quality and stability of the product.


## Indicators ⟡
- The number of bug reports from users is increasing.
- The team is spending more time fixing bugs than building new features.
- The team is afraid to make changes to the codebase for fear of breaking something.
- The team is constantly in a state of firefighting.
- The team has a low level of test coverage.

## Detection Methods ○

- **Bug Tracking Metrics:** Monitor metrics like the number of new bugs per release, the time it takes to resolve them, and the number of critical bugs.
- **Retrospectives:** Hold regular team retrospectives to discuss recent failures and identify the root causes.
- **Code Coverage Analysis:** Use tools to measure code coverage and identify areas of the codebase that are not well-tested.
- **User Feedback Analysis:** Systematically collect and analyze user feedback to identify common pain points and recurring issues.
- **Test Automation Reports:** Analyze reports from automated test runs to identify gaps or failures.
- **Manual Test Case Review:** Review manual test cases to identify areas where automation could be introduced or coverage improved.


## Examples
A software company releases a new version of its flagship product. Within hours, the support desk is flooded with calls from users who are experiencing crashes and data loss. The development team is forced to work around the clock to release a patch, and the company's reputation is damaged. In another case, a team relies heavily on manual testing. A key tester is on vacation during a release cycle, and a critical bug in a new feature is missed. The bug makes it to production and causes a major outage. This problem is often a sign that a development team has accumulated significant "technical debt." The team is so focused on short-term deadlines that they are not investing in the long-term health of their codebase and development processes.

A new feature is released, and immediately, users report that a critical workflow is broken. Investigation reveals that while individual components were tested, the end-to-end flow involving multiple services was never tested in an integrated environment. In another case, a developer makes a small change to a utility function. Without unit tests for that function, they don't realize it has a side effect that breaks another, seemingly unrelated part of the application, leading to a regression bug in production. This problem often stems from a culture that prioritizes speed over quality, or a lack of understanding of the long-term benefits of a robust testing strategy. It can lead to significant technical debt and a constant state of firefighting.
