## Description
High maintenance costs are a common problem for legacy systems. As a system ages, it becomes more and more expensive to maintain. This is because the codebase becomes more complex, the technology becomes obsolete, and the original developers leave the company. Eventually, the cost of maintaining the system can become so high that it is no longer economically viable. At this point, the company is faced with a difficult choice: either invest in a costly modernization project or continue to pour money into a dying system.

## Indicators ⟡
- The development team spends more than 50% of its time on maintenance tasks.
- The company is constantly deferring new projects because it can't afford to both maintain the old system and build new ones.
- The cost of fixing a bug is often higher than the cost of the original feature.
- The business is hesitant to approve any changes to the system because of the high cost and risk.

## Symptoms ▲
- [Legacy Skill Shortage](legacy-skill-shortage.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.660, Strength: 0.872">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The high maintenance costs arise from the reliance on outdated technologies that require specialized knowledge, and the critical shortage of developers with these skills exacerbates the maintenance burden, leading to increased effort and budget allocation towards keeping the system operational rather than innovating or improving it.
- [Regulatory Compliance Drift](regulatory-compliance-drift.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.520, Strength: 0.752">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The high maintenance costs associated with legacy systems hinder timely updates and adaptations to regulatory requirements, resulting in compliance drift that signals the growing burden of maintaining outdated technology.
- [Increased Customer Support Load](increased-customer-support-load.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.397, Strength: 0.641">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Frequent user frustrations and task completion issues arise from outdated functionalities and bugs in the system, which, due to high maintenance costs, divert resources away from necessary updates and improvements, leading to an increased customer support load.
- [Legacy API Versioning Nightmare](legacy-api-versioning-nightmare.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.394, Strength: 0.806">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Poorly designed APIs in legacy systems lead to complex versioning and compatibility issues, which escalate maintenance efforts and costs, thereby diverting resources away from innovation and new development.
- [Frequent Changes to Requirements](frequent-changes-to-requirements.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.393, Strength: 0.606">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Frequent changes to requirements often arise in legacy systems due to outdated documentation and a lack of flexibility, which results in costly rework and inefficiencies, ultimately driving up maintenance costs as teams struggle to adapt to evolving needs without a stable foundation.
- [Unreleased Resources](unreleased-resources.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.388, Strength: 0.641">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The excessive allocation of system resources without proper deallocation indicates inefficient code management and technical debt, leading to increased time and costs for maintenance as developers must spend additional effort troubleshooting and resolving issues stemming from these unreleased resources.
- [Review Process Breakdown](review-process-breakdown.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.333, Strength: 0.547">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The failure of code review practices to effectively identify and resolve issues leads to accumulating technical debt, which in turn increases maintenance efforts and costs, highlighting the inefficiencies within the legacy system.
- [Monolithic Architecture Constraints](monolithic-architecture-constraints.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.325, Strength: 0.697">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The difficulty in maintaining, scaling, and deploying large monolithic codebases arises from their complexity, leading to increased time and resources spent on maintenance rather than innovation, thereby driving up overall maintenance costs.
- [Legacy System Documentation Archaeology](legacy-system-documentation-archaeology.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.322, Strength: 0.871">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The reliance on outdated documentation and fragmented knowledge leads to increased time spent deciphering system functions and troubleshooting issues, thereby driving up maintenance costs as teams struggle to understand and modify the legacy system effectively.
- [Analysis Paralysis](analysis-paralysis.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.316, Strength: 0.692">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The excessive focus on maintaining outdated systems often leads to teams being overwhelmed by the complexity of required changes, resulting in prolonged research phases that hinder the transition to practical implementation and stifle innovation.
- [Inefficient Development Environment](inefficient-development-environment.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.316, Strength: 0.595">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The high maintenance costs lead to an inefficient development environment because outdated tools and processes consume excessive time and resources, forcing the team to spend more effort on fixing issues rather than innovating or improving system performance.
- [Slow Development Velocity](slow-development-velocity.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.308, Strength: 0.655">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The disproportionate allocation of resources to maintain a complex and outdated system leads to diminished team capacity and focus on new development, resulting in a predictable slowdown in feature delivery and bug resolution.
- [Delayed Bug Fixes](delayed-bug-fixes.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.300, Strength: 0.693">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The high maintenance costs divert resources away from timely bug resolution, leading to prolonged unresolved issues that exacerbate user frustration and impede system performance.
- [Reduced Innovation](reduced-innovation.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.300, Strength: 0.667">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The excessive resources devoted to maintaining outdated systems drain team capacity and morale, leading to a narrowed focus on immediate operational needs and a reluctance to pursue innovative solutions.

## Detection Methods ○
- **Cost of Ownership Analysis:** Calculate the total cost of owning and maintaining the system over its lifetime. This will give you a clear picture of the financial impact of the system.
- **Maintenance vs. New Development Ratio:** Track the percentage of the development budget that is spent on maintenance versus new development. A high ratio is a clear sign of a problem.
- **Bug Fix Cost Analysis:** Analyze the cost of fixing bugs over time. A rising cost is a sign that the system is becoming more difficult to maintain.
- **Business Value Assessment:** Assess the business value that the system is providing. If the cost of maintaining the system is greater than the value it is providing, it is time to consider decommissioning it.

## Examples
A large financial institution is running its core banking system on a mainframe that is over 30 years old. The system is written in COBOL, and it is becoming increasingly difficult and expensive to find developers who are proficient in the language. The company is spending millions of dollars a year just to keep the system running. They are unable to invest in new, innovative products because all of their resources are tied up in maintaining the old system. The company is stuck in a difficult position: they know that they need to modernize their system, but they are afraid of the cost and risk of such a large project.
