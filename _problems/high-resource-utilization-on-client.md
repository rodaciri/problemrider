## Description
High resource utilization on the client-side can lead to a poor user experience. This can manifest as a sluggish user interface, a high level of battery consumption on mobile devices, or a general feeling of unresponsiveness. Common causes of high resource utilization include inefficient JavaScript, large, unoptimized assets, and excessive DOM manipulation. A focus on client-side performance is essential for creating a fast and responsive user experience.


## Indicators ⟡
- Your application is slow, even on a powerful device.
- Your application is draining the battery on your mobile device.
- Your computer's fan is running at high speed when you use your application.
- You are getting complaints from users about slow performance.


## Symptoms ▲

- [Developer Frustration and Burnout](developer-frustration-and-burnout.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.421, Strength: 0.634">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Excessive resource consumption in client applications leads to frequent performance issues and urgent bug fixes, creating a stressful environment for developers who must constantly address these challenges, ultimately resulting in their frustration and burnout.
- [Unreleased Resources](unreleased-resources.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.373, Strength: 0.640">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Excessive consumption of CPU or memory often occurs when system resources such as objects or connections are improperly managed, resulting in unreleased resources that accumulate over time and degrade performance, particularly on less powerful devices.
- [Increased Customer Support Load](increased-customer-support-load.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.368, Strength: 0.616">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Excessive CPU or memory usage in client applications can lead to slow performance and task failures, prompting users to seek help from support, thereby increasing the customer support load as they report their frustrations and difficulties.
- [Upstream Timeouts](upstream-timeouts.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.362, Strength: 0.544">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Excessive CPU or memory consumption by client applications can lead to slower processing times and delayed responses to API requests, resulting in upstream services timing out due to the inability to process requests within the configured limits.
- [Unbounded Data Growth](unbounded-data-growth.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.340, Strength: 0.628">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Excessive resource consumption on client applications can stem from unbounded data growth, as the increasing volume of data leads to higher memory and CPU demands for processing, ultimately degrading performance and user experience.
- [High Defect Rate in Production](high-defect-rate-in-production.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.328, Strength: 0.765">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Excessive resource consumption often leads to performance issues that hinder testing effectiveness, resulting in a higher rate of undetected defects in the production environment.

## Root Causes ▼

- [Bottleneck Formation](bottleneck-formation.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.386, Strength: 0.901">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Inefficient processes and constraints in system components lead to suboptimal resource allocation and management, causing client applications to overutilize CPU and memory, particularly on less capable devices.
- [Lazy Loading](lazy-loading.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.339, Strength: 0.851">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The excessive number of unnecessary database queries generated by lazy loading results in increased data processing and memory consumption on the client side, ultimately leading to high resource utilization and a degraded user experience, particularly on devices with limited capabilities.
- [Insufficient Design Skills](insufficient-design-skills.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.337, Strength: 0.920">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of necessary design skills leads to inefficient algorithms and poorly optimized code, resulting in excessive resource consumption that degrades performance on client devices.
- [Work Queue Buildup](work-queue-buildup.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.331, Strength: 0.885">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The accumulation of tasks in queues intensifies processing delays, forcing client applications to overcompensate by consuming more CPU and memory resources, which ultimately degrades performance on less powerful devices.

## Detection Methods ○

- **Browser Developer Tools:** Use the Performance, Memory, and Network tabs in browser developer tools to profile client-side activity.
- **Real User Monitoring (RUM):** RUM tools can collect client-side performance metrics from actual users.
- **Device Monitoring Tools:** Use OS-level tools (e.g., Activity Monitor on macOS, Task Manager on Windows, Android Studio Profiler) to monitor CPU and memory usage of the client application.
- **User Feedback:** Pay attention to user complaints about performance, battery life, or device overheating.


## Examples
A complex web application with many interactive elements becomes very slow and causes the user's laptop fan to spin up. Profiling with browser developer tools reveals that a JavaScript function is constantly re-rendering a large part of the DOM in an inefficient loop. In another case, a mobile game has unoptimized textures and models. When played on an older phone, the game frequently lags and causes the device to become very hot, draining the battery quickly. This problem is increasingly common as applications become more feature-rich and run on a wider variety of devices. Optimizing client-side performance is crucial for a good user experience, especially on mobile and lower-end hardware.
