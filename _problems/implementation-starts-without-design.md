## Description

Implementation starts without design occurs when development teams begin coding immediately without first establishing a clear architectural vision, system structure, or detailed design. This rush to code often stems from time pressure, excitement to start building, or misconceptions about agile development practices. The result is systems that evolve organically without coherent structure, leading to code that is difficult to understand, maintain, and extend. This problem is particularly damaging in legacy modernization projects where the opportunity to establish better architecture is lost.

## Indicators ⟡

- Development work begins immediately after requirements gathering without design phases
- Architecture discussions happen during implementation rather than before
- No clear system structure or component boundaries defined upfront
- Database schemas created on-the-fly as development progresses
- API designs emerging organically rather than being planned
- Team members unsure about overall system architecture or design patterns
- Technology choices made individually by developers during implementation

## Symptoms ▲
- [Data Migration Integrity Issues](data-migration-integrity-issues.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.439, Strength: 0.759">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  When development begins without a clear design, it leads to poorly defined data structures that exacerbate schema mismatches and format incompatibilities during migration, resulting in integrity issues as the legacy data fails to align with the new system's expectations.
- [Reduced Innovation](reduced-innovation.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.396, Strength: 0.765">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of a clear design framework during development leads to chaotic code that stifles creativity and discourages teams from exploring innovative solutions, as they become preoccupied with maintaining functionality over improvement.
- [Technical Architecture Limitations](technical-architecture-limitations.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.390, Strength: 0.688">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  When development begins without a clear design, it results in haphazard coding practices that fail to adhere to architectural principles, ultimately revealing limitations in the system's architecture that hinder performance and maintainability.
- [Inadequate Configuration Management](inadequate-configuration-management.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.326, Strength: 0.745">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of a coherent design leads to inconsistent coding practices and undocumented changes, which directly results in poor tracking and management of code versions, making configuration management failures more likely to occur as a symptom of the initial disorganization.
- [Slow Development Velocity](slow-development-velocity.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.310, Strength: 0.719">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of a clear design before development leads to poor code organization and architectural drift, which in turn complicates feature implementation and bug fixes, resulting in a noticeable decline in development velocity.

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○

- Review project timelines for allocation of design and architecture activities
- Examine code repositories for evidence of consistent architectural patterns
- Conduct architecture reviews early in the development process
- Monitor frequency of structural refactoring and architectural changes
- Assess team understanding of system structure through interviews or documentation reviews
- Review database schema evolution for signs of organic, unplanned growth
- Analyze code metrics for consistency in design patterns and structural organization

## Examples

A startup building a new SaaS platform immediately begins coding features after defining user stories, without designing the overall system architecture. Three months into development, they realize their data model can't efficiently support multi-tenancy, their API design makes mobile app integration difficult, and their authentication system can't scale to support enterprise customers. What started as rapid feature development becomes a series of major refactoring efforts, each requiring weeks of work and risking the introduction of bugs. The team spends more time restructuring existing code than building new features, and the originally tight timeline extends by months as they retrofit architectural decisions that should have been made upfront.
