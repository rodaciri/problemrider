## Description

Implicit knowledge refers to critical information about system behavior, business rules, implementation decisions, and operational practices that exists only in the minds of experienced team members rather than being explicitly documented or captured in code. This knowledge includes unwritten assumptions, contextual understanding, historical decisions, and practical know-how that is essential for understanding and maintaining the system but is not formally recorded anywhere.

## Indicators ⟡

- Experienced developers can quickly solve problems that stump newcomers
- System behavior depends on unwritten rules and assumptions
- Critical knowledge is lost when experienced team members leave
- New hires ask many questions that aren't answered in existing documentation
- Certain system behaviors can only be explained by specific individuals

- [Language Barriers](language-barriers.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.365, Strength: 0.661">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The reliance on unwritten assumptions and undocumented practices creates inconsistencies in terminology and understanding, leading to language barriers that obstruct effective communication and collaboration within the team.
- [Unbounded Data Structures](unbounded-data-structures.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.361, Strength: 0.602">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The presence of unwritten assumptions and undocumented practices leads to unregulated growth in data structures, as developers may lack clear guidelines for managing data, resulting in memory exhaustion and performance issues in legacy systems.
- [Test Debt](test-debt.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.352, Strength: 0.818">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  In legacy systems, the lack of documented critical knowledge leads to reliance on informal practices, resulting in insufficient quality assurance processes that accumulate test debt, which manifests as increased fragility and slower development velocity.
- [Manual Deployment Processes](manual-deployment-processes.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.346, Strength: 0.659">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The reliance on unwritten assumptions and undocumented practices leads to a lack of standardized deployment procedures, resulting in manual interventions that increase the risk of errors and inconsistencies during the release process.
- [Inexperienced Developers](inexperienced-developers.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.345, Strength: 0.760">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of documented system knowledge leads to inexperienced developers struggling to understand and apply best practices, resulting in challenges in maintaining and evolving legacy systems effectively.
- [Difficult Code Reuse](difficult-code-reuse.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.343, Strength: 0.708">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The difficulty in reusing code arises from the lack of explicit documentation and standardized practices, leading to a reliance on implicit knowledge that hinders modular design and integration across different contexts.
- [Poor Operational Concept](poor-operational-concept.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.343, Strength: 0.770">ⓘ</span>

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○

- **Knowledge Dependency Mapping:** Identify which team members are consulted for specific types of problems
- **New Hire Question Analysis:** Track the types and frequency of questions asked by new team members
- **Documentation Gap Assessment:** Compare system complexity with the comprehensiveness of written documentation
- **Expert Availability Impact:** Measure how system understanding suffers when key individuals are unavailable
- **Decision Archaeology:** Investigate how many system decisions lack documented rationale

## Examples

A legacy financial trading system has a configuration parameter that must be set to a specific value during market holidays, but this requirement exists nowhere in the documentation. Only the senior architect knows that this setting prevents a race condition that occurs when market data feeds are inconsistent during holiday schedules. When the architect goes on vacation and a junior developer deploys a configuration change, the system experiences data corruption issues that take days to identify and resolve. Another example involves an e-commerce platform where the order processing logic has subtle timing dependencies that require specific database queries to be executed in a particular sequence. This knowledge exists only in the heads of two senior developers who learned it through years of troubleshooting production issues. When the team tries to optimize the order processing code, they inadvertently break these timing assumptions and cause intermittent order failures that are extremely difficult to reproduce and debug.
