## Description

Inadequate configuration management occurs when organizations lack proper systems and processes to track, control, and manage changes to code, configuration files, infrastructure, and other system components throughout their lifecycle. This problem extends beyond simple version control to encompass the broader challenge of maintaining consistency and traceability across all elements that make up a software system, including deployment configurations, infrastructure definitions, and environmental settings.

## Indicators ⟡

- Configuration changes made directly in production environments without tracking
- Multiple versions of configuration files scattered across different environments
- Manual processes for managing infrastructure and deployment configurations
- Difficulty determining what configuration was deployed when issues arise
- Configuration drift between different environments (dev, staging, production)
- No clear process for reviewing and approving configuration changes
- Lack of audit trail for who made what changes and when

- Evaluate change approval and tracking processes for all configuration updates
- Survey teams about configuration-related challenges and pain points
- Analyze deployment failure rates related to configuration issues
- Review configuration backup and recovery procedures and testing

## Examples

A microservices application experiences a critical production outage when a database connection timeout setting is manually changed on one server to resolve a performance issue, but the change isn't documented or applied consistently across all instances. Three weeks later, during a routine server replacement, the new instance uses the original timeout setting, causing intermittent failures that take days to diagnose. The team discovers that production servers have accumulated dozens of undocumented configuration tweaks over months, each made to address specific issues but never properly tracked or standardized. When they try to automate deployments, they realize they cannot reproduce the current production configuration because there's no record of what changes were made, when, or why. The team must spend weeks reverse-engineering their own production environment to establish a baseline for proper configuration management.
