## Description

Inadequate error handling occurs when applications fail to properly anticipate, catch, and manage error conditions, leading to unhandled exceptions, application crashes, and poor user experiences. This includes missing error handling code, generic error responses that don't help users or developers, and error handling that doesn't maintain application stability.


## Indicators ⟡

- Frequent application crashes due to unhandled exceptions
- Generic error messages that don't provide useful information
- Error conditions causing entire application or service failures
- Users encountering technical error messages instead of user-friendly explanations
- Error handling code missing from critical application paths


## Symptoms ▲

- [Upstream Timeouts](upstream-timeouts.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.525, Strength: 0.717">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  When error handling is inadequate, failed API requests can lead to prolonged response times without appropriate fallback mechanisms, resulting in upstream services timing out as they await responses that never come.
- [Poor Test Coverage](poor-test-coverage.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.495, Strength: 0.738">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of thorough testing in critical code sections often results in unhandled exceptions being overlooked, which directly contributes to the inadequate management of errors and ultimately leads to application instability.
- [Flaky Tests](flaky-tests.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.378, Strength: 0.740">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Flaky tests often arise from inadequate error handling, as unhandled exceptions during test execution can lead to inconsistent test outcomes, obscuring the reliability of the test suite in legacy systems.
- [Legacy Skill Shortage](legacy-skill-shortage.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.365, Strength: 0.668">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of robust error handling in legacy systems often leads to frequent application failures, which in turn increases the demand for skilled developers to troubleshoot and maintain these systems, thus highlighting the critical shortage of personnel familiar with outdated technologies.
- [Inadequate Test Data Management](inadequate-test-data-management.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.311, Strength: 0.792">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of robust error handling often leads to insufficiently tested scenarios, where unrealistic or outdated test data is used, resulting in a failure to uncover critical exceptions and vulnerabilities that would otherwise be addressed during testing.

## Root Causes ▼

- [Scaling Inefficiencies](scaling-inefficiencies.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.301, Strength: 0.889">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Inefficient scaling prevents the independent enhancement of error handling capabilities across system components, resulting in inadequate mechanisms to manage exceptions effectively, which ultimately leads to application crashes and poor user experiences.

## Detection Methods ○

- **Exception Monitoring:** Monitor application logs for unhandled exceptions and error patterns
- **Error Rate Analysis:** Track error rates and types across different application components
- **User Experience Testing:** Test how users experience and recover from error conditions
- **Error Message Review:** Review error messages for clarity and appropriateness
- **Code Review for Error Handling:** Review code for proper exception handling patterns


## Examples

An e-commerce checkout process fails to handle network timeout errors when communicating with the payment processor. When timeouts occur, the application crashes with an unhandled exception, leaving customers unsure whether their payment was processed. Users see a generic "Application Error" message instead of being informed about the payment status and next steps. Another example involves a file upload feature that doesn't validate file size limits before processing. When users upload files that are too large, the application runs out of memory and crashes, affecting all users. Proper error handling would check file size limits upfront and provide clear feedback about size restrictions.
