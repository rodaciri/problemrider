## Description

Inadequate initial reviews occur when the first round of code review fails to identify important issues, design problems, or potential improvements that should have been caught early. This results in multiple review cycles where new issues are discovered in each round, extending the review process unnecessarily and creating frustration for both authors and reviewers. The problem indicates that reviewers are not conducting thorough analysis during their initial examination of the code.

## Indicators ⟡

- Issues that should have been obvious are only identified in later review rounds
- Each review round reveals completely new categories of problems
- Reviewers provide only superficial feedback initially, then deeper analysis in subsequent rounds
- Important design or architectural issues are missed until after implementation details are reviewed
- Review quality improves significantly in later rounds compared to initial reviews

## Symptoms ▲
- [Poor Test Coverage](poor-test-coverage.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.439, Strength: 0.668">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Inadequate initial reviews lead to overlooked code issues, resulting in critical areas of the codebase lacking test coverage, which ultimately exposes the system to undetected defects and compromises quality assurance.
- [Inefficient Development Environment](inefficient-development-environment.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.345, Strength: 0.737">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The slow and cumbersome development environment exacerbates incomplete code reviews by discouraging thorough analysis, as developers rush to meet performance demands, leading to critical issues being overlooked until later stages.
- [Flaky Tests](flaky-tests.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.338, Strength: 0.686">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Incomplete or superficial first-round code reviews fail to catch critical issues in the code, leading to unstable test environments and unreliable tests that reflect underlying quality problems in the software.

## Root Causes ▼
- [Duplicated Effort](duplicated-effort.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.363, Strength: 0.857">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The superficiality of first-round code reviews arises from team members duplicating efforts on similar issues, leading to a lack of thorough examination as reviewers may focus on their own contributions rather than collaboratively identifying critical problems.
- [Large Estimates for Small Changes](large-estimates-for-small-changes.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.336, Strength: 0.813">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The tendency to provide large time estimates for seemingly small changes highlights the underlying complexity of the legacy code, which leads reviewers to overlook critical issues during initial reviews due to a lack of clarity and understanding of potential risks.

## Detection Methods ○

- **Issue Discovery Pattern Analysis:** Track when different types of issues are identified across review rounds
- **First-Round Effectiveness Measurement:** Assess what percentage of total issues are caught in initial reviews
- **Review Quality Progression:** Analyze whether review feedback gets significantly deeper in later rounds
- **Reviewer Performance Assessment:** Compare different reviewers' ability to identify issues early
- **Time Investment Correlation:** Examine relationship between time spent on initial review and issue discovery

## Examples

A developer submits a complex feature implementation and receives initial review feedback focused entirely on code formatting and variable naming. Only in the third review round does a reviewer notice that the algorithm has O(n²) complexity and could be optimized, and in the fourth round someone identifies that the error handling could cause data corruption. The issues that required the most significant rework should have been caught immediately but were missed because the initial reviewer only looked at surface-level style issues. Another example involves a security-sensitive authentication feature where the first reviewer approves the implementation after checking only the happy path logic. In the second round, a different reviewer identifies that the error handling reveals sensitive information, and in the third round someone discovers that the session management has a race condition vulnerability. These critical security issues should have been the primary focus of the initial review but were missed due to superficial analysis.
