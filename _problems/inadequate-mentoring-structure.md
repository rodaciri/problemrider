## Description

Inadequate mentoring structure occurs when organizations do not have a well-defined, systematic approach to mentoring and supporting new developers. This results in ad-hoc mentoring arrangements, inconsistent guidance quality, and uneven distribution of mentoring responsibilities. Without proper structure, some new hires receive excellent support while others struggle with minimal guidance, and experienced developers may become overwhelmed or avoid mentoring altogether.

## Indicators ⟡

- No formal mentoring program or process exists
- Mentoring assignments are made randomly or based on availability rather than skills match
- There are no guidelines or training for mentors
- Some new hires receive intensive support while others get minimal attention
- Experienced developers express reluctance to take on mentoring responsibilities

## Detection Methods ○

- **Mentoring Program Assessment:** Evaluate the existence and effectiveness of formal mentoring structures
- **New Hire Experience Analysis:** Survey new hires about the quality and consistency of mentoring they received
- **Mentor Participation Tracking:** Monitor which team members participate in mentoring and their workload
- **Knowledge Transfer Efficiency:** Measure how effectively critical knowledge is passed to new team members
- **Onboarding Outcome Comparison:** Compare success rates between well-mentored and poorly-mentored new hires

## Examples

A software company hires six new developers over three months but has no formal mentoring program. Three new hires are informally paired with helpful senior developers who provide excellent guidance, regular check-ins, and structured learning paths. The other three new hires are left largely on their own because the remaining senior developers are either too busy or uncomfortable with mentoring. After six months, the well-mentored developers are contributing productively while the others are still struggling with basic tasks and considering leaving. Another example involves a team where mentoring responsibilities fall entirely on one generous senior developer who becomes the default mentor for every new hire. As the team grows, this developer spends 60% of their time on mentoring activities, becomes burned out, and eventually requests to be moved to a different team to escape the constant mentoring demands.
