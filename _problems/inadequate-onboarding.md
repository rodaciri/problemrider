## Description
Inadequate onboarding is the failure to provide new users with the guidance and support they need to be successful with an application. This can be a result of a lack of a clear and concise introduction to the application, a failure to provide a guided tour of the key features, or a lack of a clear and accessible help system. A poor onboarding experience can lead to a high rate of user abandonment, as users who are unable to figure out how to use the application will quickly become frustrated and give up.

## Indicators ⟡
- A high percentage of new users are abandoning the application after a short period of time.
- The support team is receiving a high volume of questions from new users.
- New users are not using the key features of the application.

## Symptoms ▲
- [Frequent Changes to Requirements](frequent-changes-to-requirements.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.464, Strength: 0.701">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Frequent changes to requirements often arise from new users' misunderstanding of the application’s functionality, leading to continuous adjustments as they seek clarification, which indicates a lack of effective onboarding processes.
- [Legacy Skill Shortage](legacy-skill-shortage.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.464, Strength: 0.750">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The difficulty in onboarding new users to the application highlights a reliance on outdated technologies, which in turn exacerbates the shortage of skilled developers familiar with these systems, creating a cycle of inefficiency and increased user abandonment.
- [Increased Customer Support Load](increased-customer-support-load.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.428, Strength: 0.775">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The frequent need for customer support arises from users' confusion and inability to navigate the application due to insufficient onboarding, highlighting a lack of effective guidance that is critical in legacy systems with outdated interfaces and processes.
- [Quality Blind Spots](quality-blind-spots.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.391, Strength: 0.768">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Insufficient onboarding processes prevent new users from fully engaging with the application, resulting in overlooked critical behaviors and failure modes that go untested, thereby exposing quality blind spots in the legacy system.
- [Inefficient Development Environment](inefficient-development-environment.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.362, Strength: 0.720">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The slow and cumbersome development environment indicates inadequate onboarding by revealing that developers lack familiarity with the tools and processes necessary to effectively build and maintain the application, leading to inefficiencies that hinder user experience and contribute to early abandonment.

## Root Causes ▼
- [Implicit Knowledge](implicit-knowledge.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.326, Strength: 0.816">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The presence of unwritten assumptions and undocumented practices in legacy systems creates a knowledge gap for new users, making it difficult for them to access crucial information needed for effective application usage, ultimately leading to confusion and early abandonment.

## Detection Methods ○
- **User Testing:** Observe new users as they go through the onboarding process to identify areas of confusion and frustration.
- **User Surveys:** Collect feedback from new users about their onboarding experience.
- **Analytics:** Track user behavior during the onboarding process to identify where users are dropping off.

## Examples
A company launches a new social media application. However, the application does not have a clear and concise onboarding process. As a result, many new users are confused about how to use the application and quickly abandon it. The company has to invest in a complete redesign of the onboarding process to improve the user experience and reduce the churn rate.
