## Description

Inadequate requirements gathering occurs when teams begin development without sufficiently understanding, analyzing, or documenting what needs to be built. This can involve rushing through requirements analysis, failing to engage the right stakeholders, missing edge cases, or not validating assumptions about user needs. Poor requirements gathering leads to solutions that don't address the actual problems, requiring costly rework and potentially failing to deliver business value.

## Indicators ⟡

- Development begins with vague or high-level requirements
- Key stakeholders are not involved in requirements definition
- Requirements documents are incomplete or ambiguous
- Edge cases and error conditions are not considered
- User workflows and business processes are not thoroughly understood

## Symptoms ▲
- [Poor Test Coverage](poor-test-coverage.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.654, Strength: 0.888">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Insufficiently defined requirements often result in unclear acceptance criteria, leading to inadequate test coverage as critical functionalities may not be identified or prioritized for validation, thus exposing blind spots in the quality assurance process of legacy systems.
- [Legacy Skill Shortage](legacy-skill-shortage.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.478, Strength: 0.752">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Insufficient requirements gathering often leads to poorly defined legacy systems that are difficult to maintain and understand, resulting in a shortage of knowledgeable developers who can effectively manage and update these systems.
- [Inefficient Development Environment](inefficient-development-environment.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.437, Strength: 0.755">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of clear and complete requirements results in frequent changes and rework during development, leading to a slow and cumbersome environment as the team struggles to adapt to evolving needs and fix issues that arise from misunderstood specifications.
- [Poor Caching Strategy](poor-caching-strategy.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.414, Strength: 0.812">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of clear requirements often leads to inefficient design decisions, such as failing to implement effective caching mechanisms, resulting in excessive data retrieval that degrades system performance and responsiveness.

## Root Causes ▼
- [Eager to Please Stakeholders](eager-to-please-stakeholders.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.407, Strength: 0.908">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The project team's tendency to accommodate every stakeholder request without critical evaluation results in a lack of clear priorities and focus, ultimately leading to poorly defined requirements that fail to address the core needs of the system.
- [Large Estimates for Small Changes](large-estimates-for-small-changes.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.386, Strength: 0.830">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The tendency to provide large time estimates for small changes reveals the underlying code complexity and risk, which discourages thorough exploration and clarification of requirements, ultimately leading to inadequate analysis and documentation that fails to capture actual needs.
- [Perfectionist Culture](perfectionist-culture.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.365, Strength: 0.888">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  A perfectionist culture fosters analysis paralysis, causing teams to overanalyze and delay requirements gathering, resulting in incomplete or unclear specifications that fail to address the actual needs of legacy systems.
- [Implicit Knowledge](implicit-knowledge.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.330, Strength: 0.804">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The absence of documented knowledge leads to reliance on unwritten assumptions, resulting in a failure to capture complete and accurate requirements, which ultimately causes the developed solutions to misalign with user needs.
- [Bottleneck Formation](bottleneck-formation.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.327, Strength: 0.901">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Bottlenecks in team communication and workflow can prevent thorough analysis and discussion of requirements, resulting in incomplete documentation that fails to capture the true needs of stakeholders in legacy systems.
- [Constantly Shifting Deadlines](constantly-shifting-deadlines.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.323, Strength: 0.931">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Constantly shifting deadlines create a reactive environment where the development team is forced to prioritize immediate feature requests over thorough requirements analysis, resulting in incomplete understanding of user needs and ultimately leading to solutions that fail to meet actual requirements.
- [Partial Bug Fixes](partial-bug-fixes.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.319, Strength: 0.928">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  In legacy systems, the failure to comprehensively address bugs due to incomplete fixes obscures the true requirements needed for the system, leading to a misunderstanding of user needs and resulting in inadequate documentation and analysis of those requirements.
- [Gold Plating](gold-plating.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.311, Strength: 0.891">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The tendency to add unnecessary features stems from a lack of clear and prioritized requirements, resulting in solutions that diverge from user needs and further complicate the system, making it harder to address the actual requirements effectively.
- [Monitoring Gaps](monitoring-gaps.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.309, Strength: 0.914">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Insufficient production monitoring limits the ability to identify and understand user needs and system behaviors, resulting in a lack of critical insights that inform and shape the requirements gathering process, ultimately causing solutions that fail to address actual user demands.

## Detection Methods ○

- **Requirements Quality Assessment:** Evaluate completeness, clarity, and testability of requirements
- **Stakeholder Coverage Analysis:** Assess whether all relevant stakeholders contributed to requirements
- **Change Request Frequency:** Track how often requirements change during development
- **User Acceptance Testing Results:** Measure how well delivered solutions meet user expectations
- **Rework Percentage:** Calculate percentage of development effort spent on rework due to requirement issues

## Examples

A development team is asked to build a customer support ticketing system and receives high-level requirements like "track customer issues" and "assign tickets to support agents." Without deeper analysis, they build a basic system with ticket creation, assignment, and status updates. When they demo the system, support managers reveal they need complex routing rules based on customer tiers, integration with multiple communication channels, SLA tracking, escalation procedures, and reporting capabilities that weren't mentioned in the original requirements. The basic system they built cannot accommodate these needs and must be significantly redesigned. Another example involves an e-commerce team building a product recommendation engine based on the requirement to "show related products." They implement a simple algorithm based on product categories, but later discover the business actually needs personalized recommendations based on user behavior, purchase history, seasonal trends, and inventory levels. The simple category-based approach provides little business value and must be completely replaced with a more sophisticated system.
