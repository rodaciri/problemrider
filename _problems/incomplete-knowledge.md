## Description
Incomplete knowledge is a common problem in software development. It occurs when developers are unaware of all the locations where similar logic exists. This can lead to a number of problems, including synchronization problems, code duplication, and a great deal of frustration for the development team. Incomplete knowledge is often a sign of a poorly documented system with a high degree of code duplication.

## Indicators ⟡

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○
- **Developer Surveys:** Ask developers about their knowledge of the system.
- **Code Reviews:** Code reviews are a great way to identify knowledge gaps.
- **Pair Programming:** Pair programming is a great way to share knowledge between developers.
- **Knowledge Mapping:** Create a knowledge map of the system to identify areas where there are knowledge gaps.

## Examples
A company has a large, complex system. The system is not well-documented, and there is a high rate of turnover in the team. As a result, the team has a very incomplete knowledge of the system. The team is constantly reinventing the wheel, and they are not able to answer questions about the system. The company eventually has to hire a team of consultants to document the system and train the team.
