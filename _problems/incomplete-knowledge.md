## Description
Incomplete knowledge is a common problem in software development. It occurs when developers are unaware of all the locations where similar logic exists. This can lead to a number of problems, including synchronization problems, code duplication, and a great deal of frustration for the development team. Incomplete knowledge is often a sign of a poorly documented system with a high degree of code duplication.

## Indicators ⟡
- The team is constantly reinventing the wheel.
- The team is not aware of all of the features in the system.
- The team is not sure how the system is supposed to behave.
- The team is not able to answer questions about the system.

## Symptoms ▲
- **[Synchronization Problems](synchronization-problems.md):** Changes made to one copy of the code are not propagated to the other copies.
- **[Code Duplication](code-duplication.md):** The same code is duplicated in multiple places.
- **[Knowledge Gaps](knowledge-gaps.md):** There are gaps in the team's knowledge of the system.
- **[Difficult Developer Onboarding](difficult-developer-onboarding.md):** It takes a long time for new developers to get up to speed on the system.

## Root Causes ▼
- **Lack of Documentation:** The system is not well-documented, which makes it difficult for developers to learn about it.
- **Lack of a Knowledge Sharing Culture:** There is no culture of knowledge sharing in the team.
- **[High Turnover](high-turnover.md):** There is a high rate of turnover in the team, which means that knowledge is constantly being lost.
- **Lack of a Centralized Knowledge Base:** There is no centralized knowledge base where developers can go to find information about the system.

## Detection Methods ○
- **Developer Surveys:** Ask developers about their knowledge of the system.
- **Code Reviews:** Code reviews are a great way to identify knowledge gaps.
- **Pair Programming:** Pair programming is a great way to share knowledge between developers.
- **Knowledge Mapping:** Create a knowledge map of the system to identify areas where there are knowledge gaps.

## Examples
A company has a large, complex system. The system is not well-documented, and there is a high rate of turnover in the team. As a result, the team has a very incomplete knowledge of the system. The team is constantly reinventing the wheel, and they are not able to answer questions about the system. The company eventually has to hire a team of consultants to document the system and train the team.
