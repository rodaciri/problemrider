## Description
Incomplete projects are a common problem in software development. They occur when features are started but never finished due to shifting priorities, a lack of clear requirements, or other unforeseen circumstances. This can lead to a number of problems, including a great deal of wasted effort, a sense of frustration for the development team, and a loss of credibility for the organization. Incomplete projects are often a sign of a poorly managed project.

## Indicators ⟡

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○
- **Work in Progress (WIP):** Track the amount of work that is in progress at any given time.
- **Cycle Time:** Track the amount of time that it takes to complete a feature.
- **Throughput:** Track the number of features that are being completed over time.
- **Team Retrospectives:** Discuss the team's feelings about incomplete projects in your retrospectives.

## Examples
A team is working on a new mobile app. The team is constantly being asked to start new features before they have finished the old ones. As a result, the team has a large number of partially completed features. The team is not delivering any value to the users, and they are becoming increasingly frustrated. The project is eventually canceled.
