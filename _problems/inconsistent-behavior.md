## Description
Inconsistent behavior is a common problem in software systems. It occurs when the same business process produces different outcomes depending on where it is triggered. This can lead to a number of problems, including a confusing and unpredictable user experience, a loss of trust in the system, and a great deal of frustration for the development team. Inconsistent behavior is often a sign of a poorly designed system with a high degree of code duplication.


## Indicators ⟡
- The system behaves differently in different parts of the application.
- The team is constantly getting bug reports about inconsistent behavior.
- The team is not sure how the system is supposed to behave.
- The team is not able to reproduce bugs that are reported by users.

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○
- **Integration Testing:** Use integration testing to verify that the system behaves consistently across different parts of the application.
- **User Acceptance Testing:** Get feedback from users about the system's behavior.
- **Code Audits:** Audit the codebase to identify duplicated code and other potential sources of inconsistent behavior.
- **Log Analysis:** Analyze the logs to identify inconsistencies in the system's behavior.


## Examples
An e-commerce website has two different checkout flows: one for regular customers and one for guest customers. The two flows are similar, but there are subtle differences in the way they handle shipping and payment information. This leads to confusion for users, and it is a frequent source of customer support calls. The problem could be solved by creating a single, unified checkout flow that is used by both regular and guest customers.
