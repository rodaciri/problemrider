## Description

Inconsistent naming conventions occur when different parts of a codebase use varying styles, patterns, or approaches for naming variables, functions, classes, files, and other code elements. This creates confusion for developers trying to understand, navigate, or modify the code, as they cannot rely on predictable patterns to understand the purpose or scope of different elements. The problem extends beyond simple style preferences to impact code comprehension, maintenance efficiency, and team collaboration.


## Indicators ⟡

- Code reviews that frequently include naming style corrections or suggestions
- Multiple naming patterns coexisting within the same module or project
- New team members asking questions about naming conventions or struggling to find code elements
- Lack of documented naming standards or style guides for the project
- Different teams or individuals following their own naming preferences
- IDE or editor warnings about inconsistent naming patterns across the codebase
- Search and refactoring operations that are complicated by unpredictable naming

## Detection Methods ○

- Use static analysis tools to identify naming pattern inconsistencies
- Conduct code reviews focused specifically on naming convention adherence
- Analyze codebase with tools that can detect different naming styles (camelCase, snake_case, etc.)
- Survey development team about difficulties in code navigation and comprehension
- Review search patterns and frequency of "find in files" operations for naming variations
- Examine refactoring tool effectiveness and accuracy in the current codebase
- Track time spent during code reviews on naming-related discussions
- Assess new developer onboarding feedback about codebase navigation challenges


## Examples

A web application codebase shows wildly inconsistent naming: some functions use camelCase (`getUserData()`), others use snake_case (`get_user_data()`), and still others use abbreviated forms (`getUsrDat()`). Database table names mix conventions with `user_accounts`, `UserProfiles`, and `usrPrefs`. CSS classes range from `user-profile-header` to `UserProfileBody` to `usr_prof_footer`. When a new developer needs to find all user-related functionality, they must search for multiple naming variations, often missing important code because they didn't anticipate all the different ways "user" might be abbreviated or styled. A simple task like renaming a user property becomes a complex endeavor requiring extensive search and replace operations across multiple naming patterns, increasing the risk of introducing bugs through missed references.
