## Description

Inconsistent quality occurs when different parts of a software system exhibit dramatically different levels of quality, maintenance, and reliability. This creates a patchwork effect where some components are robust and well-designed while others are fragile, poorly documented, or difficult to maintain. This inconsistency often emerges when there's no systematic approach to quality standards or when different teams or individuals take varying levels of care with their work.

## Indicators ⟡

- Some system modules are reliable while others frequently break
- Code quality varies dramatically between different parts of the codebase
- User experience differs significantly across different features
- Some areas have comprehensive tests while others have none
- Documentation quality varies widely across different components

## Detection Methods ○

- **Quality Metric Analysis:** Compare code quality metrics (complexity, test coverage, bug rates) across different system components
- **User Feedback Analysis:** Track user complaints and satisfaction scores for different features
- **Developer Surveys:** Ask team members about their experience working with different parts of the system
- **Code Review Patterns:** Analyze the types and frequency of issues found in reviews for different areas
- **Maintenance Effort Tracking:** Monitor how much time is spent maintaining different system components

## Examples

A financial application has a modern, well-tested payment processing module with comprehensive error handling and logging, while the account management system is a poorly documented legacy component with minimal tests and frequent bugs. Users experience smooth payment flows but constantly encounter issues when updating their profile information. Another example involves an e-commerce platform where the product catalog search is fast and reliable, but the shopping cart frequently loses items and has confusing behavior, leading to customer complaints and abandoned purchases.
