## Description

Increased cognitive load occurs when developers must use excessive mental resources to understand, navigate, and modify code. This happens when codebases are inconsistent, overly complex, poorly organized, or lack clear patterns and conventions. High cognitive load leads to developer fatigue, increased error rates, and slower development velocity. It's particularly problematic in legacy systems where multiple coding styles, patterns, and architectural decisions have accumulated over time without coherent organization.

## Indicators ⟡
- Developers take longer than expected to complete seemingly simple tasks
- Team members frequently ask for help understanding existing code
- Code reviews take an unusually long time as reviewers struggle to understand the changes
- New team members have difficulty becoming productive even after extended onboarding
- Developers express frustration about the difficulty of working with certain parts of the codebase

## Detection Methods ○
- **Time Tracking:** Monitor how long simple tasks take compared to estimates or historical averages
- **Developer Surveys:** Ask team members about their experience working with different parts of the codebase
- **Code Complexity Metrics:** Use tools to measure cyclomatic complexity, nesting depth, and function length
- **Onboarding Time:** Track how long it takes new developers to become productive in different areas of the system
- **Code Review Duration:** Monitor how long code reviews take, especially for seemingly simple changes

## Examples

A developer needs to add a simple validation rule to a user registration form. The existing codebase has validation implemented in four different ways across different modules: some use a third-party library, others use custom validation classes, some embed validation logic directly in controllers, and one module uses a completely different framework. To add the new validation consistently with the registration module, the developer must first spend hours understanding which approach that specific module uses, then learn the patterns and conventions specific to that approach. What should be a 15-minute task becomes a multi-hour investigation. Another example involves a financial calculation module where business logic is scattered across 12 different files with varying naming conventions, making it nearly impossible to understand the complete calculation flow without opening multiple files simultaneously and maintaining a mental map of how they interact.
