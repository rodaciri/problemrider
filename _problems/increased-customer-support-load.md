## Description

Increased customer support load occurs when technical problems, poor user experience design, or system defects cause users to contact support more frequently than necessary. This creates a cascading effect where technical problems not only affect users directly but also strain support resources, increase operational costs, and divert attention from other business activities. The support team becomes overwhelmed with issues that should have been prevented through better software quality.

## Indicators ⟡
- Support ticket volume increases without corresponding user growth
- High percentage of support requests relate to software bugs or usability issues
- Support representatives spend significant time on recurring technical problems
- Customer satisfaction scores decline due to support experience
- Support costs increase disproportionately to user base growth

## Symptoms ▲
- **Support Resource Strain:** Customer support team becomes overwhelmed with technical issue reports
- **Increased Operational Costs:** More support staff needed to handle the volume of technical complaints
- **Longer Response Times:** Users wait longer for support responses due to high ticket volume
- **Reduced Support Quality:** Support representatives have less time to provide thorough assistance
- **Support Team Burnout:** Customer service representatives become frustrated with recurring technical issues

## Root Causes ▼
- **[High Defect Rate in Production](high-defect-rate-in-production.md):** Bugs and system failures generate support requests for problems users can't resolve
- **[Poor User Experience (UX) Design](poor-user-experience-ux-design.md):** Confusing interfaces cause users to contact support for help with basic tasks
- **Inadequate Error Handling:** Poor error messages leave users unable to understand or resolve problems independently
- **Insufficient Documentation:** Lack of self-service resources forces users to contact support for basic questions
- **Complex User Workflows:** Overly complicated processes require support assistance to complete routine tasks
- **System Performance Issues:** Slow or unreliable systems generate complaints and support requests

## Detection Methods ○
- **Support Ticket Categorization:** Classify tickets to identify what percentage relate to technical issues vs. legitimate support needs
- **Ticket Volume Trends:** Monitor support request volume relative to user base growth
- **Common Issue Analysis:** Track the most frequent support requests to identify recurring technical problems
- **Support Cost Analysis:** Calculate the cost impact of technical issues on support operations
- **User Self-Service Success Rate:** Measure how often users can resolve issues without contacting support

## Examples

An online banking application has a confusing password reset process that frequently fails due to technical issues with email delivery and session management. Instead of the intended 2-step self-service process, users often need to call support to reset their passwords. What should be a simple automated workflow generates hundreds of support calls per week, requiring support representatives to manually reset accounts. The support team spends 40% of their time on password-related issues that should be resolved automatically. This not only increases support costs but also creates security risks as support staff must verify user identity over the phone for account access. Another example involves an e-commerce platform where the checkout process frequently fails with unclear error messages. Instead of showing specific information like "credit card declined" or "shipping address invalid," the system displays generic "transaction failed" messages. Users contact support to complete their purchases, turning what should be automated sales into manual processes that require human intervention. The support team becomes a bottleneck for revenue generation, and many users abandon their purchases rather than deal with the support process.
