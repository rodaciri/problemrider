## Description

Increased manual testing effort occurs when teams spend excessive time on manual verification activities because automated testing is inadequate or missing. While some manual testing is valuable, particularly for user experience and exploratory testing, over-reliance on manual processes creates bottlenecks, inconsistency, and scalability problems. Manual testing becomes a limiting factor in release frequency and team productivity when it's used to compensate for insufficient automation.


## Indicators ⟡
- Significant portions of each release cycle are dedicated to manual testing activities
- Testing team or developers spend most of their time executing repetitive manual test cases
- Release schedules are constrained by manual testing capacity rather than development completion
- The same manual tests are executed repeatedly for every release or change
- Manual testing discovers bugs that should have been caught by automated tests

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○
- **Testing Time Analysis:** Track what percentage of release cycle time is spent on manual vs. automated testing
- **Test Execution Tracking:** Monitor how many test cases are executed manually vs. automatically
- **Resource Allocation:** Measure human resources dedicated to manual testing activities
- **Release Bottleneck Analysis:** Identify whether manual testing delays releases more than development work
- **Test Coverage Assessment:** Compare manual test coverage with automated test coverage


## Examples

A web application team has a comprehensive suite of manual test cases covering user registration, login, profile management, content creation, and administrative functions. Before each bi-weekly release, two team members spend three full days executing 200+ manual test cases, clicking through the application to verify that existing functionality still works. This manual regression testing consumes 30% of the team's capacity and prevents more frequent releases. When automated testing is finally implemented for the core user flows, the manual testing time is reduced to half a day focused on exploratory testing and new features, allowing the team to release weekly instead of bi-weekly. Another example involves a mobile banking application where regulatory compliance requires extensive testing of financial transactions, security features, and data handling. The team spends two weeks of manual testing for every release, with testers manually creating accounts, performing transactions, generating reports, and verifying calculations. The manual testing is not only time-consuming but also error-prone, as human testers occasionally miss edge cases or make mistakes in verification. Implementing automated testing for the core financial calculations and transaction flows reduces the manual testing burden by 70% while improving test coverage and reliability.
