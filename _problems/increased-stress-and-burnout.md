## Description

Increased stress and burnout occurs when team members experience sustained high levels of work-related stress that leads to physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion. This problem goes beyond normal work pressure and represents a chronic condition that affects individual performance, team dynamics, and overall system quality. The stress often stems from unrealistic expectations, poor work conditions, or systemic organizational problems.

## Indicators ⟡

- Team members frequently mention feeling overwhelmed or stressed
- Increased sick days, mental health days, or requests for time off
- Visible signs of fatigue, irritability, or disengagement during work
- Team members work excessive hours regularly to meet expectations
- Productivity and code quality decline despite increased effort

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○

- **Stress Level Surveys:** Regular anonymous surveys about team member stress and satisfaction levels
- **Work Hour Tracking:** Monitor actual hours worked compared to planned schedules
- **Health and Wellness Metrics:** Track sick days, stress-related absences, and wellness program usage
- **Performance Correlation Analysis:** Analyze correlation between stress indicators and work quality
- **Exit Interview Analysis:** Understand stress-related factors in team member departures

## Examples

A development team consistently works 60-hour weeks to meet quarterly release deadlines, with team members skipping vacations and working weekends to deliver features on time. Three team members develop stress-related health issues including insomnia and anxiety, and two resign citing burnout and work-life balance concerns. Code quality begins declining as the remaining team members make more mistakes due to fatigue and mental exhaustion. Another example involves a support team that handles both development work and production incidents, with team members being on-call 24/7 and frequently interrupted during development work to handle urgent issues, creating chronic stress from never being able to focus on planned work or have predictable schedules.
