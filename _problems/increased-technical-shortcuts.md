## Description

Increased technical shortcuts occurs when development teams consistently choose quick, expedient solutions over proper, well-designed implementations due to delivery pressure or time constraints. These shortcuts may solve immediate problems but create technical debt, reduce code quality, and make future development more difficult. The pattern represents a shift from sustainable development practices toward unsustainable quick fixes.


## Indicators ⟡

- Developers frequently mention "doing it the quick way" or "just to get it working"
- Code reviews reveal more quick fixes and workarounds than usual
- Technical debt items are created but immediately deprioritized
- Solutions are implemented without proper design consideration
- Team discussions focus on "getting it done" rather than "getting it right"


## Symptoms ▲

- [Poor Test Coverage](poor-test-coverage.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.482, Strength: 0.698">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The reliance on quick fixes often leads developers to prioritize immediate delivery over comprehensive testing, resulting in critical parts of the codebase being left untested and creating significant blind spots in quality assurance.

<br/>  The reliance on quick fixes and workarounds in legacy systems often leads to functionality issues and user confusion, which in turn results in an increased volume of support requests as users struggle to navigate the system effectively.
- [Inefficient Development Environment](inefficient-development-environment.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.397, Strength: 0.643">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The pressure to implement quick fixes often leads to neglecting performance optimizations in the development environment, resulting in sluggish processes that further hinder effective development and exacerbate the reliance on temporary solutions.
- [Legacy Skill Shortage](legacy-skill-shortage.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.394, Strength: 0.634">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The reliance on quick fixes due to delivery pressure leads to complex and poorly documented systems, which in turn discourages skilled developers from engaging with legacy technologies, ultimately resulting in a critical shortage of expertise needed for effective maintenance.
- [Reduced Individual Productivity](reduced-individual-productivity.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.383, Strength: 0.643">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The reliance on quick fixes leads to increased complexity and technical debt in the system, which in turn causes developers to spend more time troubleshooting and dealing with unforeseen issues, ultimately reducing their overall productivity.
- [Developer Frustration and Burnout](developer-frustration-and-burnout.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.382, Strength: 0.619">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The reliance on quick fixes leads to a more complex and unstable codebase, which in turn causes frustration and burnout among developers as they struggle to manage the increasing technical debt and persistent issues resulting from inadequate solutions.
- [Slow Development Velocity](slow-development-velocity.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.378, Strength: 0.679">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The reliance on quick fixes leads to a tangled codebase that complicates future development efforts, resulting in slower delivery times as the team spends more resources managing the growing maintenance burden rather than implementing new features or resolving issues efficiently.
- [Technical Architecture Limitations](technical-architecture-limitations.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.365, Strength: 0.701">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The reliance on quick fixes due to delivery pressures often leads to architectural decisions that prioritize immediate functionality over long-term design principles, resulting in systemic limitations that hinder performance and maintainability in legacy systems.
- [Team Members Not Engaged in Review Process](team-members-not-engaged-in-review-process.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.334, Strength: 0.686">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of meaningful engagement in code reviews creates a cycle where insufficient scrutiny allows for more quick fixes to be accepted, further eroding code quality and compounding future maintenance challenges.
- [Interrupt Overhead](interrupt-overhead.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.326, Strength: 0.691">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The reliance on quick fixes leads to inefficient coding practices that generate excessive hardware interrupts, which disrupt CPU execution and manifest as reduced application performance, highlighting the underlying issues caused by prioritizing short-term solutions over sustainable design.
- [Reduced Innovation](reduced-innovation.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.325, Strength: 0.652">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The reliance on quick fixes leads teams to prioritize immediate deliverables over comprehensive solutions, resulting in a culture that stifles creativity and discourages the exploration of innovative approaches to problem-solving.
- [Product Direction Chaos](product-direction-chaos.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.306, Strength: 0.669">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of clear product leadership leads to conflicting priorities among stakeholders, which pressures the development team to implement quick fixes and workarounds instead of proper solutions, ultimately resulting in increased maintenance challenges within legacy systems.
- [Reduced Feature Quality](reduced-feature-quality.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.302, Strength: 0.753">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The reliance on quick fixes and workarounds to meet delivery pressures directly reduces the time and resources allocated for thorough testing and refinement, leading to features that are inadequately polished and ultimately degrade user experience.

## Root Causes ▼

- [Release Instability](release-instability.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.369, Strength: 0.837">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Frequent instability in production releases forces developers to implement quick fixes and workarounds to address urgent issues, leading to an accumulation of technical shortcuts that compromise long-term maintainability.
- [Tangled Cross-Cutting Concerns](tangled-cross-cutting-concerns.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.319, Strength: 0.875">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The tight coupling of essential cross-cutting concerns with business logic forces developers to implement quick fixes and workarounds to meet delivery pressures, ultimately leading to increased technical shortcuts and complicating future maintenance.
- [Premature Technology Introduction](premature-technology-introduction.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.316, Strength: 0.743">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The introduction of untested technologies increases the complexity and risk of projects, leading teams to prioritize quick fixes over comprehensive solutions to meet deadlines, ultimately resulting in a reliance on temporary workarounds that complicate future maintenance.

## Detection Methods ○

- **Code Review Analysis:** Monitor comments and patterns indicating shortcuts in code reviews
- **Technical Debt Tracking:** Track rate of technical debt creation vs. resolution
- **Code Quality Metrics:** Monitor complexity and maintainability metrics over time
- **Developer Surveys:** Ask team members about pressure to take shortcuts
- **Sprint Planning Analysis:** Track ratio of "quick fixes" vs. "proper solutions" in sprint planning


## Examples

A development team working on an e-commerce platform consistently chooses quick database query fixes over proper indexing strategies because indexing changes require more testing and coordination. Over 6 months, they've added dozens of one-off query optimizations that make the database schema increasingly complex and difficult to maintain. Another example involves a team that repeatedly adds conditional logic and special cases to existing functions rather than refactoring them properly, because refactoring takes more time upfront. A single user registration function has grown to 800 lines with nested conditionals handling dozens of special cases that could have been handled through proper object-oriented design.
