## Description

Increased time to market occurs when the duration from concept to customer delivery consistently grows longer, reducing the organization's ability to respond quickly to market opportunities, customer needs, or competitive pressures. This problem affects business competitiveness and can result in lost revenue, reduced market share, and missed opportunities to capitalize on trends or customer demands.


## Indicators ⟡

- Feature development cycles are taking longer than historical averages
- Competitors are releasing similar features faster
- Business opportunities are missed due to slow delivery timelines
- Revenue projections are consistently delayed due to development timeline extensions
- Market feedback indicates products feel dated or behind industry standards

## Detection Methods ○

- **Time to Market Tracking:** Measure duration from feature concept to customer availability
- **Competitive Analysis:** Compare release timelines with competitor feature delivery speeds
- **Business Impact Assessment:** Analyze revenue or market share effects of delayed releases
- **Customer Feedback Analysis:** Monitor customer requests for features available in competing products
- **Development Cycle Analysis:** Track how development cycle times change over time


## Examples

A financial services company identifies a market opportunity for mobile payment features that their competitors don't offer, but their 18-month development timeline means that by the time they deliver, three competitors have launched similar features and captured significant market share. The extended timeline is due to complex legacy system integrations, lengthy compliance review processes, and technical debt in their mobile platform that makes new features difficult to implement. Another example involves a social media platform that takes 8 months to implement features that competitors deliver in 2-3 months, causing users to migrate to platforms with more current functionality. The delays stem from a monolithic architecture that requires extensive regression testing and a complex deployment process that adds weeks to each release cycle.
