## Description
An individual recognition culture is a culture where individual accomplishments are valued more than team accomplishments. This is a common problem in companies that have a traditional, hierarchical management structure. An individual recognition culture can lead to a number of problems, including knowledge silos, poor communication, and team coordination issues.

## Indicators ⟡
- Individual performance is rewarded more than team performance.
- There is a lot of competition between team members.
- Team members are not willing to help each other.
- There is a lack of trust on the team.

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Communication Breakdown](communication-breakdown.md):** There is a lack of communication on the team because team members are not willing to share information with each other.
- **[Team Coordination Issues](team-coordination-issues.md):** The teams have difficulty coordinating their work because they are not willing to help each other.
