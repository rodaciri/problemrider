## Description
Inefficient frontend code can have a significant impact on the user experience. This can manifest as a slow-loading page, a sluggish user interface, or a high level of resource consumption on the client's machine. Common causes of inefficient frontend code include large, unoptimized assets, excessive DOM manipulation, and a lack of proper caching. A focus on frontend performance is essential for creating a fast and responsive user experience.

## Indicators ⟡
- The application is slow, even on a powerful device.
- The application is draining the battery on your mobile device.
- Your computer's fan is running at high speed when you use your application.
- You are getting complaints from users about slow performance.

## Symptoms ▲
- [Frequent Changes to Requirements](frequent-changes-to-requirements.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.426, Strength: 0.634">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Constantly changing requirements often stem from performance issues caused by inefficient frontend code, as stakeholders may request modifications to enhance user experience or speed, revealing underlying deficiencies in the system that necessitate rework and iterative adjustments.
- [Upstream Timeouts](upstream-timeouts.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.425, Strength: 0.614">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Inefficient frontend code can lead to increased processing times and delays in rendering, which may cause the API response times to exceed their configured limits, resulting in timeouts for dependent services.
- [Increased Customer Support Load](increased-customer-support-load.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.381, Strength: 0.623">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Frustrating user experiences caused by slow and unresponsive interfaces lead to increased customer inquiries, as users struggle to complete tasks efficiently due to performance bottlenecks in the frontend code.
- [Unreleased Resources](unreleased-resources.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.348, Strength: 0.651">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Inefficient frontend code can lead to excessive and prolonged execution of scripts that fail to release allocated resources, resulting in unreleased objects and connections that compound performance issues in legacy systems.
- [Quality Blind Spots](quality-blind-spots.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.328, Strength: 0.778">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Inefficient frontend code often leads to performance bottlenecks that obscure system behaviors, making it difficult to identify critical failure modes, thereby creating blind spots in testing coverage and verification practices.
- [High Defect Rate in Production](high-defect-rate-in-production.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.322, Strength: 0.774">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The presence of unoptimized JavaScript and excessive DOM manipulation can lead to unpredictable behavior and performance issues in the user interface, resulting in a higher frequency of bugs being reported in production as developers struggle to account for complex interactions and edge cases during testing.
- [Slow Development Velocity](slow-development-velocity.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.319, Strength: 0.656">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Inefficient frontend code increases the time developers spend debugging and optimizing performance issues, leading to delays in feature delivery and a noticeable decline in overall productivity.

## Root Causes ▼
- [Procedural Background](procedural-background.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.333, Strength: 0.928">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Developers accustomed to procedural programming may inadvertently write inefficient, non-optimized code in an object-oriented environment due to a lack of understanding of best practices, leading to performance issues like excessive DOM manipulation and unoptimized JavaScript.
- [Bikeshedding](bikeshedding.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.326, Strength: 0.889">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The tendency to prioritize trivial code reviews leads to overlooked performance issues in the frontend, resulting in unoptimized JavaScript and inefficient rendering practices that degrade the overall user experience.
- [Atomic Operation Overhead](atomic-operation-overhead.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.308, Strength: 0.884">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The excessive use of atomic operations leads to performance bottlenecks that slow down the execution of JavaScript and increase the time required for DOM manipulations and complex CSS animations, thereby contributing to inefficient frontend code in legacy systems.

## Detection Methods ○

- **Browser Developer Tools:** Use the Performance, Memory, and Network tabs in browser developer tools to profile CPU usage, memory consumption, and rendering performance.
- **Lighthouse/PageSpeed Insights:** Use these tools to get automated audits and suggestions for frontend performance.
- **Real User Monitoring (RUM):** RUM tools can collect client-side performance metrics from actual user sessions.
- **Code Review:** Look for common anti-patterns like direct DOM manipulation in loops, complex CSS selectors, or large JavaScript files.
- **Web Vitals:** Monitor Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) to understand user experience.

## Examples
A web application displays a large table with thousands of rows. Each time a user sorts or filters the table, the entire DOM is re-rendered, causing a noticeable freeze in the UI. Implementing a virtualized list or table component would significantly improve performance. In another case, a JavaScript function is responsible for updating a counter on the screen every second. Instead of directly updating the text content of a single DOM element, it re-creates the entire element and appends it to the DOM, leading to constant reflows and high CPU usage. With the increasing complexity of web applications and the demand for rich user experiences, efficient frontend code is paramount. This problem is common in applications that have grown organically without a strong focus on performance optimization or where developers lack deep knowledge of browser rendering pipelines.
