## Description

Information decay occurs when documentation, specifications, and knowledge artifacts gradually become outdated, inaccurate, or incomplete as systems evolve. This decay happens because documentation maintenance is often deprioritized compared to feature development, and the effort required to keep information current is underestimated. As information decays, teams lose confidence in existing documentation and resort to tribal knowledge or code archaeology, making the system increasingly difficult to understand and maintain.

## Indicators ⟡

- Documentation hasn't been updated despite significant system changes
- Team members frequently discover that documented procedures don't work as described
- New team members report that existing documentation is misleading or unhelpful
- Code comments contradict actual system behavior
- API documentation doesn't match current API functionality

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○

- **Documentation Freshness Audit:** Track when documentation was last updated relative to system changes
- **Accuracy Verification:** Test documented procedures and compare with actual system behavior
- **User Feedback Analysis:** Monitor complaints about inaccurate or unhelpful documentation
- **Onboarding Experience Assessment:** Evaluate new team member success with existing documentation
- **Documentation Usage Tracking:** Monitor which documentation is accessed and which is ignored
- **Knowledge Gap Identification:** Identify areas where system knowledge exists only in people's heads

## Examples

A legacy financial system has comprehensive documentation that was created during the initial implementation five years ago, but hasn't been updated despite numerous feature additions and architectural changes. New developers attempting to understand the payment processing module find that the documented database schema is missing three tables and several columns that were added for regulatory compliance. The API documentation shows endpoints that no longer exist and is missing documentation for new authentication requirements. When issues arise in production, developers must reverse-engineer the current system behavior rather than relying on documentation, significantly extending troubleshooting time. Another example involves a microservices platform where the service architecture documentation shows the original design with six services, but the system has evolved to include twelve services with complex interdependencies. The deployment documentation still references the old containerization approach and doesn't mention the current Kubernetes setup, making it impossible for new team members to successfully deploy the application.
