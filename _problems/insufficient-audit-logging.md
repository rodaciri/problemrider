## Description

Insufficient audit logging occurs when applications fail to properly log security-relevant events such as authentication attempts, authorization failures, data access, configuration changes, or administrative actions. This lack of comprehensive audit trails makes it difficult to detect security breaches, investigate incidents, maintain regulatory compliance, or establish accountability for system actions.

## Indicators ⟡

- Security incidents cannot be traced through log analysis
- Regulatory compliance audits fail due to missing log data
- Unable to determine who performed specific administrative actions
- Authentication and authorization events not logged
- Data access and modification events not tracked

## Symptoms ▲
- [Poor Test Coverage](poor-test-coverage.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.310, Strength: 0.551">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  In legacy systems, the lack of comprehensive audit logging often results in inadequate test coverage because developers cannot effectively validate the security and integrity of critical code paths without visibility into security events and potential vulnerabilities, leading to undetected issues in the software.

## Detection Methods ○

- **Security Event Coverage Analysis:** Review what security events are currently being logged
- **Compliance Requirement Mapping:** Map compliance requirements to current logging capabilities
- **Incident Investigation Testing:** Test ability to investigate security incidents using available logs
- **Audit Trail Completeness Review:** Verify that complete audit trails exist for critical operations
- **User Activity Tracking Assessment:** Assess coverage of user activity logging

## Examples

A healthcare application processes patient medical records but only logs successful database queries, not failed access attempts or unauthorized data access tries. When a data breach investigation occurs, investigators cannot determine which accounts attempted to access specific patient records, when unauthorized access attempts were made, or trace the full scope of potentially compromised data. The lack of comprehensive audit logging makes it impossible to satisfy HIPAA audit requirements or properly investigate the breach. Another example involves a financial application that logs user logins but not what data users access or modify after authentication. When suspicious activity is detected in customer accounts, investigators can see when users logged in but cannot determine what financial data was viewed, modified, or exported, making it impossible to assess the impact of potential fraud or data theft.
