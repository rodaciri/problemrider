## Description
Insufficient design skills are a major contributor to the creation of legacy code. When a development team lacks the necessary skills and experience to design and build well-structured, maintainable software, they are likely to create a system that is difficult to understand, modify, and test. This can lead to a number of problems, including a high rate of bugs, a slow development velocity, and a great deal of frustration for the development team. Insufficient design skills are a common problem in the software industry, and it can be difficult to address.

## Indicators ⟡
- The codebase is a "big ball of mud."

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○
- **Code Reviews:** Code reviews are a great way to identify design problems.
- **Code Complexity Metrics:** Use static analysis tools to measure the complexity of the codebase.
- **Developer Surveys:** Ask developers about their confidence in their design skills.
- **Architectural Assessments:** Conduct an assessment of the system's architecture to identify design flaws.

## Examples
A company hires a team of junior developers to build a new web application. The developers are not experienced in software design, and they do not have a mentor to guide them. As a result, they create a system that is poorly designed and difficult to maintain. The company is not able to deliver new features in a timely manner, and they are constantly struggling with bugs. The company eventually has to hire a team of experienced developers to rewrite the entire system.
