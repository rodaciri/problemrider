## Description
Insufficient design skills are a major contributor to the creation of legacy code. When a development team lacks the necessary skills and experience to design and build well-structured, maintainable software, they are likely to create a system that is difficult to understand, modify, and test. This can lead to a number of problems, including a high rate of bugs, a slow development velocity, and a great deal of frustration for the development team. Insufficient design skills are a common problem in the software industry, and it can be difficult to address.

## Indicators ⟡
- The codebase is a "big ball of mud."
- The team is constantly struggling with technical debt.
- The team is not able to deliver new features in a timely manner.
- The team is not proud of the code that they are writing.

## Symptoms ▲
- **[Complex and Obscure Logic](complex-and-obscure-logic.md):** The codebase is difficult to understand and maintain.
- **[High Coupling and Low Cohesion](high-coupling-low-cohesion.md):** The components of the system are tightly coupled and have low cohesion.
- **[Difficult to Test Code](difficult-to-test-code.md):** The code is difficult to test, which leads to a high rate of bugs.
- **[Slow Development Velocity](slow-development-velocity.md):** It takes a long time to develop and release new features.

## Root Causes ▼
- **Lack of Training:** The team has not been properly trained in software design principles and patterns.
- **Lack of Experience:** The team does not have enough experience to be able to design and build well-structured software.
- **Slow Knowledge Transfer:** There is no one on the team who can mentor the other developers and help them to improve their design skills.
- **[Time Pressure](time-pressure.md):** The team is under pressure to deliver features quickly, and they do not have time to focus on good design.
- **Lack of a Design Culture:** The organization does not value good design, and there is no incentive for developers to improve their design skills.

## Detection Methods ○
- **Code Reviews:** Code reviews are a great way to identify design problems.
- **Code Complexity Metrics:** Use static analysis tools to measure the complexity of the codebase.
- **Developer Surveys:** Ask developers about their confidence in their design skills.
- **Architectural Assessments:** Conduct an assessment of the system's architecture to identify design flaws.

## Examples
A company hires a team of junior developers to build a new web application. The developers are not experienced in software design, and they do not have a mentor to guide them. As a result, they create a system that is poorly designed and difficult to maintain. The company is not able to deliver new features in a timely manner, and they are constantly struggling with bugs. The company eventually has to hire a team of experienced developers to rewrite the entire system.
