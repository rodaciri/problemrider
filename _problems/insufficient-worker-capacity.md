## Description
Insufficient worker capacity is a common problem in systems that use a worker model for asynchronous processing. When there are not enough workers to handle the volume of tasks being produced, the task queue will back up, leading to delays in processing and a potential for data loss. This can be caused by a variety of factors, from a sudden spike in traffic to a gradual increase in the workload over time. Properly sizing the worker pool is essential for ensuring the stability and performance of the system.

## Indicators ⟡
- The number of messages in your queue is growing.
- The time it takes to process a message is increasing.
- Your workers are constantly running at high CPU or memory usage.
- You are getting alerts from your monitoring system about the queue size.

## Symptoms ▲
- [Increased Customer Support Load](increased-customer-support-load.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.464, Strength: 0.728">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The inability to process tasks efficiently due to limited worker capacity leads to delayed responses and unmet user needs, causing frustration that drives an increase in customer support inquiries.
- [Upstream Timeouts](upstream-timeouts.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.442, Strength: 0.666">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of sufficient worker processes leads to increased task queues, causing delays in processing requests, which in turn results in upstream services timing out due to their inability to receive timely responses.
- [Inefficient Development Environment](inefficient-development-environment.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.421, Strength: 0.672">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  A slow and cumbersome development environment can arise from insufficient worker capacity, as developers may face delays in testing and deploying code due to overwhelmed processes, resulting in increased wait times for task completion and hindering overall productivity.
- [Frequent Changes to Requirements](frequent-changes-to-requirements.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.414, Strength: 0.662">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The constant need to adjust project requirements arises from the inability of the limited worker processes to keep pace with task completion, creating a perception of inadequacy that prompts stakeholders to frequently revise expectations, thereby compounding delays and rework in the development lifecycle.
- [Unreleased Resources](unreleased-resources.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.405, Strength: 0.695">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of sufficient worker processes leads to tasks being queued and not completed, resulting in resources remaining allocated without being released, which serves as an indicator of the system's inability to process and manage workload efficiently.
- [Reduced Team Productivity](reduced-team-productivity.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.374, Strength: 0.675">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The inability to process tasks efficiently due to limited worker resources leads to increased bottlenecks, causing delays and frustrations that ultimately diminish the development team's productivity and effectiveness.
- [Unbounded Data Structures](unbounded-data-structures.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.373, Strength: 0.709">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of sufficient worker processes leads to unprocessed tasks accumulating in queues, causing data structures to grow unchecked and resulting in memory exhaustion and performance issues as they are unable to be efficiently managed or cleared.
- [Slow Development Velocity](slow-development-velocity.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.346, Strength: 0.717">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The inability to efficiently process incoming tasks due to a lack of worker capacity leads to prolonged backlogs, which in turn hampers the team's ability to deliver features and fixes on time, thereby manifesting as a decline in development velocity.

## Detection Methods ○

- **Queue Monitoring:** Track queue size, message rates, and consumer lag using the message queue system's monitoring tools.
- **Worker Resource Monitoring:** Monitor CPU, memory, and network I/O of worker instances. Look for consistently high utilization.
- **Application Performance Monitoring (APM):** Trace individual task processing times to identify where delays are occurring within the worker logic.
- **Load Testing:** Simulate peak load conditions to identify the point at which worker capacity becomes a bottleneck.
- **Log Analysis:** Look for logs indicating worker failures, retries, or tasks taking an unusually long time.

## Examples
An image processing service uses a queue for incoming image upload requests. Initially, one worker instance is sufficient. As user traffic grows, the queue starts to build up, and images take hours to process. Adding more worker instances immediately reduces the queue size and processing time. In another case, a batch processing system is configured to run with 4 worker threads. A new report generation task is introduced that is very CPU-intensive. When multiple report requests come in simultaneously, the 4 threads are fully utilized, and subsequent report requests sit in the queue, waiting for a thread to become free. This problem is fundamental to scalable, asynchronous systems. It highlights the need for continuous monitoring and dynamic scaling strategies to match processing capacity with demand, especially in cloud-native environments.
