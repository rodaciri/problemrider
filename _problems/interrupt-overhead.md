## Description

Interrupt overhead occurs when hardware devices generate interrupts at such a high frequency that the CPU spends excessive time handling interrupt service routines instead of executing application code. Each interrupt requires saving the current execution context, running the interrupt handler, and restoring context, which can become a significant performance bottleneck in interrupt-heavy environments.


## Indicators ⟡

- CPU performance counters show high interrupt rates
- System performance degrades under high I/O load
- Applications become unresponsive during periods of high interrupt activity
- CPU utilization is high in interrupt context rather than user applications
- Performance problems correlate with specific hardware device activity

## Detection Methods ○

- **Interrupt Rate Monitoring:** Monitor system interrupt rates using OS performance tools
- **CPU Interrupt Time Analysis:** Measure time spent in interrupt context vs normal execution
- **Per-Device Interrupt Tracking:** Identify which devices generate the most interrupts
- **Interrupt Distribution Analysis:** Check how interrupts are distributed across CPU cores
- **Application Performance Correlation:** Correlate application performance with interrupt activity
- **Hardware Performance Counters:** Use hardware counters to monitor interrupt-related metrics


## Examples

A high-performance web server receives network packets from a 10Gbps network interface that generates an interrupt for every received packet. At peak traffic, this creates 1.5 million interrupts per second, causing the CPU to spend 40% of its time in interrupt handlers rather than processing HTTP requests. Enabling interrupt coalescing to batch multiple packets per interrupt reduces interrupt frequency by 90% and improves request processing throughput by 60%. Another example involves a real-time data acquisition system where multiple sensors generate timer interrupts at microsecond intervals. The cumulative interrupt load causes the main data processing loop to miss critical timing deadlines, resulting in lost sensor readings and degraded system accuracy. Implementing interrupt prioritization and more efficient interrupt handlers restores real-time performance.
