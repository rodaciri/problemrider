## Description
A knowledge sharing breakdown occurs when the mechanisms for distributing information and expertise within a team are ineffective. This can manifest as a lack of documentation, poor communication, or a culture that does not value or reward knowledge sharing. When knowledge sharing breaks down, it can lead to a number of problems, including knowledge silos, duplicated effort, and a decline in the overall quality of the team's work.


## Indicators ⟡
- Team members are not aware of what other team members are working on.
- The same questions are asked and answered repeatedly.
- There is no easy way to find information about the system or its history.
- New team members have a difficult time getting up to speed.


## Symptoms ▲

- [Legacy Skill Shortage](legacy-skill-shortage.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.567, Strength: 0.843">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Ineffective knowledge sharing among team members leads to a lack of documentation and mentorship for legacy technologies, resulting in a critical shortage of skilled developers and increasing reliance on a few individuals, which creates maintenance bottlenecks and potential failures.
- [Team Members Not Engaged in Review Process](team-members-not-engaged-in-review-process.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.479, Strength: 0.852">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Ineffective knowledge sharing leads to a lack of diverse perspectives during code reviews, causing repeated assignments to the same reviewers who may be uninspired to provide substantial feedback, ultimately creating a bottleneck and diminishing code quality.
- [Reduced Feature Quality](reduced-feature-quality.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.443, Strength: 0.905">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Ineffective knowledge sharing among team members leads to a lack of collaboration and understanding of best practices, resulting in inadequate time and attention for feature refinement, which ultimately compromises quality and user experience in legacy systems.
- [Inefficient Development Environment](inefficient-development-environment.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.439, Strength: 0.827">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The breakdown in knowledge sharing leads to a lack of shared best practices and solutions within the team, resulting in an inefficient development environment where outdated tools and processes persist, ultimately hindering overall productivity.
- [Capacity Mismatch](capacity-mismatch.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.401, Strength: 0.831">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Ineffective knowledge sharing leads to a lack of alignment in team members' understanding of project demands and capabilities, resulting in mismatched capacity across development stages that manifests as bottlenecks and underutilization.
- [Stakeholder-Developer Communication Gap](stakeholder-developer-communication-gap.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.393, Strength: 0.811">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Ineffective knowledge sharing among team members leads to a lack of shared understanding regarding stakeholder requirements, resulting in communication gaps that manifest as rework and stakeholder dissatisfaction in the development process.
- [Reduced Innovation](reduced-innovation.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.379, Strength: 0.898">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Ineffective knowledge sharing leads to a lack of diverse ideas and collaboration among team members, resulting in a stagnant mindset that prioritizes minimal compliance over innovative solutions, which is indicative of deeper systemic issues within legacy systems.
- [Analysis Paralysis](analysis-paralysis.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.366, Strength: 0.828">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Ineffective knowledge sharing creates information silos that hinder collaboration and decision-making, leading teams to overanalyze situations without reaching conclusions or taking action, which stalls development progress.
- [Inability to Innovate](inability-to-innovate.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.366, Strength: 0.873">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The ineffective sharing of knowledge among team members prevents collaboration and the exchange of innovative ideas, resulting in a focus on routine maintenance tasks at the expense of exploring new solutions, thereby stifling innovation.
- [Reduced Team Productivity](reduced-team-productivity.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.363, Strength: 0.950">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Ineffective knowledge sharing creates information silos that hinder collaboration and learning, ultimately leading to systemic inefficiencies that reduce the overall productivity and output of the development team.
- [Project Authority Vacuum](project-authority-vacuum.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.355, Strength: 0.787">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Ineffective knowledge sharing hampers team alignment and understanding of project goals, leading to a lack of organizational support and executive sponsorship for critical initiatives, which manifests as an inability to secure necessary resources.
- [Inadequate Mentoring Structure](inadequate-mentoring-structure.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.340, Strength: 0.840">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of an effective mentoring structure highlights the breakdown in knowledge sharing, as new developers are not receiving consistent guidance from experienced team members, which exacerbates information silos and hinders collaborative learning in legacy systems.
- [Unclear Documentation Ownership](unclear-documentation-ownership.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.332, Strength: 0.779">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of clear responsibility for maintaining documentation arises from ineffective knowledge sharing practices, resulting in outdated and inconsistent information that hinders team learning and perpetuates information silos.
- [Stakeholder Dissatisfaction](stakeholder-dissatisfaction.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.331, Strength: 0.833">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Ineffective knowledge sharing among team members leads to misalignment on project goals and execution, resulting in slower development cycles and poor communication that ultimately frustrates stakeholders.
- [Poor Project Control](poor-project-control.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.328, Strength: 0.843">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Ineffective knowledge sharing leads to a lack of visibility into team dynamics and project status, resulting in unaddressed issues that escalate into significant project control problems.
- [Fear of Failure](fear-of-failure.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.324, Strength: 0.837">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The breakdown in effective knowledge sharing fosters a climate where team members hesitate to voice uncertainties or mistakes, exacerbating a fear of failure that stifles innovation and discourages risk-taking, particularly in the context of managing and evolving legacy systems.
- [Inadequate Configuration Management](inadequate-configuration-management.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.324, Strength: 0.868">ⓘ</span>

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○
- **Knowledge Mapping:** Identify the key knowledge areas in the team and who the experts are.
- **Information Flow Analysis:** Analyze how information moves through the team and identify any bottlenecks.
- **Developer Surveys:** Ask developers about their experience with knowledge sharing and whether they feel that they have access to the information they need.


## Examples
A team has a number of senior developers who have been with the company for a long time. They have a wealth of knowledge about the system, but they are not very good at sharing it with the junior developers. As a result, the junior developers are struggling to learn the system and are not able to be as productive as they could be. In another example, a team has a wiki, but it is not well-maintained. The information is out-of-date and difficult to find. As a result, team members are not using the wiki, and they are not sharing their knowledge with each other.
