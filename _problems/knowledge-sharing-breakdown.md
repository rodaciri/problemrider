## Description
A knowledge sharing breakdown occurs when the mechanisms for distributing information and expertise within a team are ineffective. This can manifest as a lack of documentation, poor communication, or a culture that does not value or reward knowledge sharing. When knowledge sharing breaks down, it can lead to a number of problems, including knowledge silos, duplicated effort, and a decline in the overall quality of the team's work.

## Indicators ⟡
- Team members are not aware of what other team members are working on.
- The same questions are asked and answered repeatedly.
- There is no easy way to find information about the system or its history.
- New team members have a difficult time getting up to speed.

## Symptoms ▲
- **[Knowledge Silos](knowledge-silos.md):** Information is concentrated in a few individuals, making the team dependent on them.
- **[Duplicated Research Effort](duplicated-research-effort.md):** Team members waste time and effort solving problems that have already been solved by others.
- **[Slow Knowledge Transfer](slow-knowledge-transfer.md):** It takes a long time for new team members to become productive.
- **[Extended Onboarding Period](extended-onboarding-period.md):** New team members require significantly longer than expected to become productive contributors.
- **[Mentor Burnout](mentor-burnout.md):** Experienced team members become overwhelmed with training responsibilities.
- **[Inconsistent Execution](inconsistent-execution.md):** Different team members use different approaches to solve similar problems, leading to an inconsistent codebase.

## Root Causes ▼
- **[Communication Breakdown](communication-breakdown.md):** There is a lack of open and effective communication within the team.
- **[Information Fragmentation](information-fragmentation.md):** There is no formal system for capturing, storing, and sharing knowledge.
- **[Implicit Knowledge](implicit-knowledge.md):** Critical system knowledge exists as unwritten assumptions and practices.
- **[Individual Recognition Culture](individual-recognition-culture.md):** The team culture rewards individual achievements over collaboration and knowledge sharing.
- **[Time Pressure](time-pressure.md):** Team members are too busy with their own tasks to take the time to share their knowledge with others.

## Detection Methods ○
- **Knowledge Mapping:** Identify the key knowledge areas in the team and who the experts are.
- **Information Flow Analysis:** Analyze how information moves through the team and identify any bottlenecks.
- **Developer Surveys:** Ask developers about their experience with knowledge sharing and whether they feel that they have access to the information they need.

## Examples
A team has a number of senior developers who have been with the company for a long time. They have a wealth of knowledge about the system, but they are not very good at sharing it with the junior developers. As a result, the junior developers are struggling to learn the system and are not able to be as productive as they could be. In another example, a team has a wiki, but it is not well-maintained. The information is out-of-date and difficult to find. As a result, team members are not using the wiki, and they are not sharing their knowledge with each other.
