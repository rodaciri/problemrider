## Description

Knowledge silos occur when critical information, expertise, or research findings are concentrated within individual team members and not effectively shared with the broader team. This creates dependencies on specific individuals, increases risk when team members leave, and leads to duplicated effort as others must rediscover the same information independently. Knowledge silos prevent teams from building collective intelligence and learning from each other's experiences.

## Indicators ⟡

- Certain team members are consistently the "go-to" person for specific topics
- Information exists but is not accessible to other team members who need it
- Similar problems are solved differently by different team members
- Team discussions reveal that members have different understandings of the same systems
- Knowledge is lost when key team members leave or are unavailable

## Detection Methods ○

- **Knowledge Mapping:** Identify who holds critical information about different system areas
- **Information Flow Analysis:** Track how information moves (or doesn't move) through the team
- **Bus Factor Assessment:** Evaluate risk if specific team members become unavailable
- **Team Surveys:** Ask about access to information and knowledge sharing experiences
- **Documentation Audit:** Review what critical information is documented vs. held by individuals

## Examples

A senior developer has spent months learning the intricacies of the payment processing system, including undocumented API quirks, error handling patterns, and performance optimization techniques. This knowledge remains in their head and personal notes, so when they take vacation, payment-related issues take much longer to resolve and new features are delayed. Other team members must rediscover the same information through trial and error. Another example involves a team where each developer has become an expert in different microservices, but they don't share their understanding of service interactions, deployment procedures, or troubleshooting approaches. When cross-service issues arise, each developer only understands their part of the system, making system-wide problems difficult to diagnose and resolve.
