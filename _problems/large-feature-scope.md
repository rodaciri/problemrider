## Description
Large feature scope is a problem that occurs when a feature is too large and complex to be developed and delivered in a single, short iteration. This can lead to a number of problems, including long-lived feature branches, a lack of visibility into the progress of the feature, and a high risk of integration problems. Breaking down large features into smaller, more manageable chunks is a key principle of agile development, and it is essential for reducing risk and delivering value to users more quickly.

## Indicators ⟡
- Features are consistently taking longer to develop than expected.
- The team is frequently dealing with merge conflicts and integration problems.
- There is a lack of visibility into the progress of a feature.

## Symptoms ▲
- [Reduced Team Productivity](reduced-team-productivity.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.396, Strength: 0.722">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The inability to break down features into smaller increments leads to prolonged development cycles and complex integration challenges, which in turn consume team resources and time, ultimately diminishing overall productivity and effectiveness.
- [Developer Frustration and Burnout](developer-frustration-and-burnout.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.372, Strength: 0.593">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The inability to break down features into manageable increments leads to prolonged development cycles and complex integration challenges, causing frustration and burnout among developers who feel overwhelmed by the continuous struggle to deliver quality work within an inefficient system.
- [Upstream Timeouts](upstream-timeouts.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.356, Strength: 0.575">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Long-lived branches from oversized features delay integration and testing, causing upstream services to experience timeouts as they await responses that are not being delivered in a timely manner due to the lack of incremental updates and increasing complexity.
- [Reduced Innovation](reduced-innovation.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.346, Strength: 0.669">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  When features are overly large and complex, teams become overwhelmed by the integration challenges, leading them to prioritize minimal viable changes over innovative solutions, thereby stifling creativity and adaptability in the development process.
- [Reduced Individual Productivity](reduced-individual-productivity.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.331, Strength: 0.680">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The difficulty in breaking down large features into manageable increments leads to prolonged development cycles and complex integration challenges, causing developers to struggle with task completion and prolonging the resolution of issues, which directly impacts their overall productivity.
- [Merge Conflicts](merge-conflicts.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.312, Strength: 0.572">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The inability to break down large features into smaller, manageable components leads to multiple developers working on the same extensive code sections simultaneously, resulting in frequent version control conflicts that hinder development progress.
- [Frequent Changes to Requirements](frequent-changes-to-requirements.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.306, Strength: 0.551">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The inability to break down features into smaller increments often leads to a lack of clarity and adaptability, resulting in constant updates to requirements as stakeholders react to incomplete or evolving understanding of the large scope, thus indicating underlying integration and management issues within the legacy system.
- [Inefficient Development Environment](inefficient-development-environment.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.304, Strength: 0.618">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The inability to decompose large features into manageable increments often leads to complex, unwieldy codebases that strain the development environment, resulting in inefficiencies and delays as teams struggle with slow builds and cumbersome integration processes.

## Root Causes ▼
- [External Service Delays](external-service-delays.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.323, Strength: 0.903">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Slow response times from dependent services hinder the ability to iteratively test and integrate smaller features, resulting in an accumulation of large, complex changes that are difficult to manage and merge effectively.
- [Brittle Codebase](brittle-codebase.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.318, Strength: 0.843">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The difficulty in modifying the existing code without introducing new bugs leads to developers avoiding incremental changes, resulting in features being scoped too large to manage effectively and increasing the risk of integration issues.
- [Insufficient Design Skills](insufficient-design-skills.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.310, Strength: 0.917">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of adequate design skills prevents the development team from effectively decomposing complex features into manageable components, resulting in the inability to implement incremental changes and exacerbating integration challenges within legacy systems.
- [Procedural Background](procedural-background.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.304, Strength: 0.913">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The inability of developers to effectively leverage object-oriented principles due to their procedural background results in complex, monolithic feature implementations that cannot be easily decomposed into manageable increments, ultimately causing prolonged integration challenges.
- [Technology Lock-In](technology-lock-in.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.304, Strength: 0.807">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The inability to adopt more flexible and modern technologies due to high costs or complexity leads to rigid architectures, which in turn necessitates large, monolithic features that cannot be easily divided into smaller, manageable increments.

## Detection Methods ○
- **Track Feature Lead Time:** Monitor the time it takes to develop and deliver a feature, from the initial idea to the final release.
- **Analyze Branching Strategy:** Look for long-lived feature branches in the version control system.
- **Team Retrospectives:** Discuss the challenges the team is facing with large features and identify ways to break them down into smaller pieces.

## Examples
A team is tasked with building a new reporting module for an application. The module is very complex and has a large number of features. The team decides to build the entire module on a single feature branch. The development takes several months, and when the team is finally ready to merge the branch, they are faced with a massive number of merge conflicts and integration problems. It takes them several more weeks to resolve the issues and release the feature. This is a classic example of how a large feature scope can lead to significant delays and a high level of risk.
