## Description
Large, risky releases are a common problem in organizations with long release cycles. When releases are infrequent, they tend to be large and complex. This is because they contain a large number of changes, which can interact in unexpected ways. Large releases are difficult to test, and they are more likely to fail than small releases. When a large release fails, it can have a significant impact on users and the business. It can also be difficult and time-consuming to roll back a large release, which can prolong the outage.


## Indicators ⟡
- Releases are a major event that requires a lot of planning and coordination.
- The team is anxious and stressed about deployments.
- There is a high rate of post-deployment bugs and other issues.
- Rollbacks are a common occurrence.

## Detection Methods ○
- **Release Size:** Track the number of changes in each release.
- **Release Failure Rate:** Track the percentage of releases that result in a critical failure.
- **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR):** Measure the average time it takes to recover from a failed release.
- **Post-Release Bug Count:** Count the number of bugs that are reported in the days and weeks following a release.


## Examples
A company releases a new version of its software once a year. The annual release is a major event that requires months of planning and coordination. The release contains a large number of new features and bug fixes. The testing process is long and arduous, but it is impossible to test every possible combination of changes. As a result, the release is always risky, and it often fails. When the release fails, it can take days to roll it back, which has a significant impact on the company's customers.
