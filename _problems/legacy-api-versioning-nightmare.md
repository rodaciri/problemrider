## Description

Legacy API versioning nightmare occurs when legacy systems expose APIs that were designed without proper versioning strategies, creating cascading compatibility challenges as business requirements evolve. These APIs often lack semantic versioning, proper deprecation processes, or backward compatibility mechanisms, making it extremely difficult to modify or extend them without breaking existing integrations. The problem compounds over time as more systems depend on these poorly versioned APIs, creating a web of dependencies that resist change.


## Indicators ⟡

- APIs that were designed without version numbers or versioning strategies
- Breaking changes to APIs that require coordinated updates across multiple dependent systems
- Integration projects that require extensive workarounds due to API limitations or inconsistencies
- Multiple versions of similar API endpoints that exist to maintain backward compatibility
- Client systems that must implement complex logic to handle API inconsistencies
- Documentation that describes different API behaviors for different system versions
- Fear of making any API changes due to potential impact on unknown dependent systems

## Detection Methods ○

- Audit existing APIs for versioning strategies and backward compatibility mechanisms
- Map API dependencies across systems to understand integration complexity
- Track API change frequency and the coordination required for updates
- Monitor client system complexity related to API compatibility handling
- Survey development teams about API-related integration challenges and constraints
- Analyze support tickets and integration failures related to API versioning issues
- Review API documentation completeness and versioning policy clarity
- Assess business agility impact from API change constraints and coordination requirements


## Examples

A retail company's inventory management API was built 8 years ago without version numbers, returning product information in a fixed JSON structure. As business requirements evolved, the team made changes like adding fields, changing data types (price from integer to decimal), and modifying field names for clarity. Each change broke some integration, so they implemented workarounds: duplicate endpoints with different names, optional parameters that change response formats, and complex conditional logic based on client identification. Now they have endpoints like `/products`, `/products_v2`, `/products_extended`, and `/products_new`, each with slightly different behaviors and field structures. Client systems contain extensive compatibility code to handle different response formats, and new integrations require developers to research which endpoint version to use and what workarounds to implement. When the business wants to add product variants and bundles, the team realizes they need to make breaking changes to the core data model, but they can't identify all the systems that depend on the existing API structure. The result is a 6-month project to add what should be a simple feature, requiring coordination across 12 different integration teams and extensive regression testing to avoid breaking existing functionality.
