## Description

Legacy code without tests refers to existing production systems that were built before comprehensive testing practices were adopted or where testing was deprioritized during development. This code is particularly challenging because it's often tightly coupled, has hidden dependencies, and lacks the design characteristics that make testing straightforward. Adding tests to legacy code requires significant effort and expertise, creating a barrier that prevents teams from improving code quality and reducing technical debt.


## Indicators ⟡
- Large portions of critical production code have no associated automated tests
- Code was written before the team adopted test-driven development or testing best practices
- Attempts to add tests to existing code require extensive refactoring
- Developers avoid modifying certain areas due to lack of test coverage
- Production systems have been running for years without comprehensive test suites


## Symptoms ▲

- [Poor Test Coverage](poor-test-coverage.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.347, Strength: 0.578">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The absence of automated tests in legacy systems leads to insufficient test coverage, as critical code paths remain untested due to the difficulty of safely modifying and incrementally adding tests to a fragile codebase.

## Root Causes ▼

- [Insufficient Design Skills](insufficient-design-skills.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.398, Strength: 0.881">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of sufficient design skills leads to poorly structured legacy systems, making it difficult to implement automated tests, as the code is not modular or understandable enough for safe modifications.
- [Procedural Background](procedural-background.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.385, Strength: 0.897">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Developers' difficulty in adopting object-oriented principles results in procedural-style code that is harder to test, ultimately contributing to the absence of automated tests in legacy systems.
- [Misunderstanding of OOP](misunderstanding-of-oop.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.349, Strength: 0.859">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  A lack of understanding of object-oriented programming leads to poorly structured legacy code that is difficult to test, creating a cycle where the absence of tests further complicates maintenance and modifications.
- [Incomplete Knowledge](incomplete-knowledge.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.331, Strength: 0.825">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of complete knowledge about existing code logic prevents developers from identifying areas that require testing, resulting in a failure to implement automated tests in legacy systems and increasing the risk of introducing errors during modifications.

## Detection Methods ○
- **Code Coverage Analysis:** Measure test coverage for different parts of the system to identify untested legacy areas
- **Code Age Analysis:** Identify older code sections that were written before testing practices were established
- **Dependency Analysis:** Map code dependencies to identify areas that would be difficult to test
- **Change Frequency vs. Test Coverage:** Correlate how often code is modified with its test coverage
- **Developer Surveys:** Ask team members which areas of code they're most afraid to modify due to lack of tests


## Examples

A 10-year-old inventory management system processes millions of dollars in transactions daily but has zero automated tests. The core inventory tracking algorithms, pricing calculations, and order fulfillment logic are all untested legacy code written by developers who have since left the company. When the business needs to add support for new product categories, developers discover that the existing code uses global variables, directly queries databases within business logic methods, and has circular dependencies between classes. Adding tests would require extensive refactoring that could break existing functionality, but modifying the code without tests is extremely risky given the financial impact of bugs. The team is trapped in a situation where they cannot safely improve the code without tests, but cannot add tests without potentially breaking the existing system. Another example involves a customer relationship management system where the lead scoring algorithms are implemented in a 3,000-line class that directly accesses external APIs, modifies database records, and sends emails. The complexity and tight coupling make it virtually impossible to create unit tests, while the lack of tests makes it dangerous to refactor the code into more testable components.
