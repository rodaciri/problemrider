## Description

Load balancing problems occur when traffic distribution mechanisms fail to efficiently route requests across available service instances, leading to uneven load distribution, performance degradation, and potential service failures. Poor load balancing can result in some instances being overwhelmed while others remain underutilized, reducing overall system efficiency and reliability.

## Indicators ⟡

- Uneven resource utilization across service instances
- Some service instances showing high load while others are idle
- Response times vary significantly across requests
- Load balancer health checks failing intermittently
- Connection pooling issues or connection exhaustion

## Symptoms ▲
- [Increased Customer Support Load](increased-customer-support-load.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.424, Strength: 0.685">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Inefficient traffic distribution leads to performance degradation and service instability, resulting in user frustration and an increased frequency of support inquiries as customers struggle to complete tasks.
- [Upstream Timeouts](upstream-timeouts.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.421, Strength: 0.624">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Inefficient traffic distribution by load balancing mechanisms leads to prolonged response times for upstream services, which in turn triggers timeouts when the responses exceed their configured limits, indicating underlying load balancing issues.
- [Poor Caching Strategy](poor-caching-strategy.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.407, Strength: 0.775">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Inefficient traffic distribution can lead to frequent data requests from the source instead of utilizing cached data, resulting in increased latency and resource strain, thereby highlighting the underlying load balancing issues.
- [Poor Project Control](poor-project-control.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.379, Strength: 0.852">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Inefficient traffic distribution and failure to adapt to changing conditions lead to performance issues that result in poor project oversight, as unresolved load balancing problems prevent timely identification of critical issues within the system.
- [Inadequate Test Data Management](inadequate-test-data-management.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.339, Strength: 0.825">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Inefficient or inflexible traffic distribution in legacy systems often leads to a reliance on outdated or unrealistic test data, as the inability to adapt to actual usage patterns results in inadequate test scenarios that fail to reveal underlying performance issues.
- [Unreleased Resources](unreleased-resources.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.330, Strength: 0.662">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Inefficient traffic distribution can lead to prolonged resource allocation without proper deallocation, as the system struggles to manage connections under uneven load, resulting in unreleased resources that indicate underlying load balancing issues.
- [Inconsistent Onboarding Experience](inconsistent-onboarding-experience.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.305, Strength: 0.790">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Inefficient distribution of resources and support in legacy systems leads to varying levels of assistance for new team members, resulting in inconsistent onboarding experiences that reflect underlying load balancing issues.

## Detection Methods ○

- **Load Distribution Monitoring:** Monitor request distribution and resource utilization across instances
- **Response Time Analysis:** Analyze response time variations across different service instances
- **Health Check Monitoring:** Monitor health check success rates and timing
- **Connection Pool Monitoring:** Track connection pool utilization and exhaustion events
- **Load Balancer Performance Metrics:** Monitor load balancer CPU, memory, and throughput

## Examples

An API gateway uses simple round-robin load balancing across service instances, but the instances have different hardware specifications - some are high-memory instances optimized for data processing while others are CPU-optimized. The round-robin approach sends equal traffic to all instances, causing the CPU-optimized instances to struggle with memory-intensive requests while memory-optimized instances handle CPU-light requests inefficiently. Implementing weighted load balancing based on instance capabilities improves overall system performance by 60%. Another example involves a web application where session affinity causes user sessions to stick to specific servers. Popular users with high activity create hot spots on certain servers while others remain underutilized. When popular user sessions concentrate on the same server, it becomes overwhelmed and starts failing, affecting user experience.
