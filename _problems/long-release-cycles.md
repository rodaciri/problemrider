## Description

Long release cycles occur when the time between software releases becomes excessive due to prolonged testing phases, extensive manual verification processes, or frequent discovery of issues late in the release process. This problem creates a bottleneck in delivering value to users and often results in larger, riskier releases that are even more difficult to test and deploy. Long cycles can become self-reinforcing as teams try to pack more features into infrequent releases, making each release even larger and more complex.


## Indicators ⟡
- Releases happen monthly, quarterly, or even less frequently when they should be more regular
- Significant portions of the release cycle are spent on manual testing or bug fixing
- Release dates are frequently postponed due to quality concerns
- Large amounts of code changes accumulate between releases
- The team spends weeks preparing for each release


## Symptoms ▲

- [Frequent Changes to Requirements](frequent-changes-to-requirements.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.411, Strength: 0.625">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Constant updates to project requirements often arise from the need to address issues discovered during prolonged manual testing phases, resulting in a cycle of rework and further delays that exacerbate release timelines.
- [Merge Conflicts](merge-conflicts.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.333, Strength: 0.601">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Frequent merge conflicts arise from developers needing to wait for lengthy manual testing to conclude, leading them to modify the same code areas simultaneously, which ultimately contributes to the delays in release cycles.

## Root Causes ▼

- [External Service Delays](external-service-delays.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.341, Strength: 0.919">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Delays in external services lead to slower API responses, resulting in extended manual testing phases and increased likelihood of last-minute bug discoveries, ultimately prolonging release cycles in legacy systems.
- [Increasing Brittleness](increasing-brittleness.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.308, Strength: 0.836">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The fragility of legacy systems leads to increased complexity in testing and debugging, as minor changes can introduce unforeseen issues that require extensive examination, ultimately extending the release cycle.
- [Bottleneck Formation](bottleneck-formation.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.305, Strength: 0.938">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Bottlenecks in specific team members or processes lead to delays in manual testing and unresolved bugs, which in turn extend overall release cycles in legacy software systems.

## Detection Methods ○
- **Release Frequency Metrics:** Track time between releases and compare to industry standards or goals
- **Release Preparation Time:** Measure how long teams spend preparing for each release
- **Bug Discovery Timing:** Monitor when bugs are found in the release cycle (late discovery indicates process issues)
- **Feature Delivery Time:** Track how long features take from completion to user availability
- **Release Size Analysis:** Measure the amount of code or number of features per release


## Examples

A software company releases updates every six months because each release requires four weeks of manual testing across different browsers, operating systems, and device configurations. During the testing phase, they typically discover 20-30 bugs that require fixes, which then need additional testing, extending the cycle further. By the time a release is ready, it contains six months' worth of changes, making it extremely difficult to identify the root cause of any issues that arise. Users frequently request features or bug fixes but must wait months to receive them. Another example involves a financial services application where regulatory compliance requires extensive documentation and approval processes for each release. The company batches changes into quarterly releases to minimize the overhead of compliance processes, but this means critical security patches or user-requested features can take up to four months to reach production, creating business risk and user dissatisfaction.
