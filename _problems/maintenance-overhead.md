## Description
Maintenance overhead is the excessive effort required to keep a software system operational and up-to-date. This is a common problem in legacy systems, where years of accumulated technical debt and design compromises have made the codebase difficult to work with. When maintenance overhead is high, the development team is forced to spend most of its time on non-productive tasks, such as fixing bugs, applying security patches, and making minor tweaks to existing functionality. This leaves little time for innovation and new feature development, which can have a significant impact on the business.


## Indicators ⟡
- The team's backlog is dominated by maintenance tasks.
- It takes a long time to make even simple changes to the system.
- The team is constantly context-switching between different maintenance tasks.
- There is a high rate of regression bugs, where a change to one part of the system breaks something else.

<br/>  The excessive time spent on maintaining a convoluted codebase with duplication and limited reusability directly hampers the development team's ability to produce new features efficiently, resulting in decreased productivity as they navigate the complexities of the legacy system.
- [Upstream Timeouts](upstream-timeouts.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.401, Strength: 0.592">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The excessive maintenance demands lead to inefficient code execution and inadequate resource management, causing delays in response times that result in services failing to meet their configured timeout thresholds.
- [Deadline Pressure](deadline-pressure.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.391, Strength: 0.809">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The excessive maintenance demands from duplicated code and a lack of reusable components create a backlog that intensifies pressure to deliver quickly, resulting in rushed decisions that further degrade software quality.
- [Review Process Breakdown](review-process-breakdown.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.390, Strength: 0.622">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The failure of code review practices to catch critical issues and enhance code quality indicates a deeper maintenance overhead, as the presence of duplicated code and lack of reusable components complicate the review process, leading to overlooked problems and prolonged system upkeep.
- [Slow Development Velocity](slow-development-velocity.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.356, Strength: 0.704">ⓘ</span>

## Root Causes ▼

- [High API Latency](high-api-latency.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.323, Strength: 0.934">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Excessive API latency forces developers to spend additional time creating workarounds and redundant code to mitigate performance issues, ultimately increasing maintenance overhead due to the proliferation of duplicated logic and a lack of efficient, reusable components.
- [Long-Running Transactions](long-running-transactions.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.309, Strength: 0.866">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Long-running transactions lead to increased contention for database resources, resulting in frequent timeouts and errors that necessitate extensive troubleshooting and code duplication, thereby escalating the maintenance burden on the system.
- [Procedural Background](procedural-background.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.307, Strength: 0.947">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The struggle of developers trained in procedural programming to effectively utilize object-oriented principles results in the creation of inefficient, duplicated code that increases maintenance overhead in legacy systems.
- [Shared Dependencies](shared-dependencies.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.305, Strength: 0.927">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The presence of shared dependencies leads to maintenance overhead as changes in one component can necessitate updates across multiple services, resulting in duplicated effort and increased complexity due to tightly coupled code and a lack of modularity.
- [External Service Delays](external-service-delays.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.302, Strength: 0.914">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Slow responses from dependent services lead to inefficient error handling and workarounds in the existing system, resulting in duplicated code and increased maintenance efforts as developers strive to manage the fallout from these delays.

## Detection Methods ○
- **Time Tracking:** Track the amount of time that the team spends on maintenance tasks versus new development. A high ratio is a clear sign of a problem.
- **Bug Density:** Measure the number of bugs per line of code. A high bug density is a sign that the codebase is difficult to maintain.
- **Code Churn:** Analyze the history of the codebase to see which files are being modified most frequently. High churn in certain files can indicate that they are a source of high maintenance overhead.
- **Developer Surveys:** Ask developers about their experience with maintenance work. Their feedback can be a valuable source of information.


## Examples
A team is responsible for maintaining a large, monolithic application. The application is written in an old version of a programming language, and it has a lot of duplicated code. The team spends most of its time fixing bugs and making small changes to the application. They have very little time for new feature development. As a result, the application is falling behind its competitors, and the business is starting to lose market share.
