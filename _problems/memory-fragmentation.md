## Description

Memory fragmentation occurs when the available memory space becomes divided into small, non-contiguous blocks due to repeated allocation and deallocation patterns. Even when sufficient total memory is available, applications may fail to allocate larger contiguous blocks, leading to allocation failures or forcing the use of slower, non-contiguous memory allocation strategies. This problem is particularly severe in long-running applications with dynamic memory allocation patterns.

## Indicators ⟡

- Memory allocation failures despite having sufficient total free memory
- Increasing allocation time for larger memory blocks
- Memory allocator reports high fragmentation levels
- Performance degradation in applications that require large contiguous allocations
- Heap compaction or garbage collection frequency increases significantly

## Root Causes ▼
- [Bikeshedding](bikeshedding.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.360, Strength: 0.858">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The tendency to prioritize trivial code reviews over critical design considerations can lead to inefficient memory allocation practices, resulting in fragmented memory that hinders the ability to allocate larger objects despite having sufficient total free memory.
- [Increasing Brittleness](increasing-brittleness.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.350, Strength: 0.808">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  As software systems become more fragile due to tightly coupled components and outdated practices, small changes can inadvertently lead to inefficient memory usage patterns, which exacerbate the issue of available memory being fragmented into non-contiguous blocks.
- [Deadlock Conditions](deadlock-conditions.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.346, Strength: 0.889">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  When multiple threads are stuck waiting for each other to release resources, they can hold onto memory blocks longer than necessary, leading to inefficient memory usage and ultimately resulting in fragmentation as smaller, unusable memory gaps accumulate.
- [Long-Running Transactions](long-running-transactions.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.313, Strength: 0.893">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Long-running transactions can monopolize memory resources by holding onto locks and preventing timely deallocation, leading to inefficient memory usage and ultimately causing fragmentation as smaller memory blocks become isolated and unavailable for larger allocations.

## Detection Methods ○

- **Memory Profiling Tools:** Use heap analysis tools to visualize memory layout and fragmentation levels
- **Allocation Pattern Analysis:** Monitor allocation sizes and patterns to identify fragmentation causes
- **Memory Manager Statistics:** Track fragmentation metrics provided by memory management systems
- **Performance Monitoring:** Monitor allocation time increases that correlate with fragmentation
- **Virtual Memory Analysis:** Analyze page fault patterns and virtual memory usage
- **Heap Dump Analysis:** Examine heap snapshots to identify fragmentation patterns

## Examples

A server application allocates various-sized buffers for network operations throughout its runtime. Small buffers are frequently allocated and deallocated, while occasional large buffers for file transfers remain allocated for extended periods. Over time, the free memory becomes highly fragmented with small gaps between long-lived large buffers. When the application needs to allocate a 1MB buffer for a large file transfer, the allocation fails despite having 10MB of total free memory distributed across thousands of small fragments. Another example involves a real-time graphics application that allocates texture data and vertex buffers of different sizes. Poor allocation ordering causes large texture allocations to fragment the heap, making subsequent allocations for animation data fail even though sufficient memory exists in total.
