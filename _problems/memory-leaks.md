## Description
A memory leak is a type of resource leak that occurs when a computer program incorrectly manages memory allocations in such a way that memory which is no longer needed is not released. Over time, these leaks can consume a significant amount of memory, leading to a degradation in performance and, eventually, a crash of the application or the entire system. Memory leaks are a common problem in languages that require manual memory management, but they can also occur in languages with automatic memory management if objects are unintentionally kept alive.

## Indicators ⟡
- The application's memory usage is constantly increasing, even when it is not under heavy load.
- The application is slow, and you suspect that it is due to a memory leak.
- The application is crashing with out-of-memory errors.
- You are getting complaints from users about slow performance.

- [Memory Swapping](memory-swapping.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.301, Strength: 0.826">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  When an application fails to release memory properly, it leads to increased memory consumption, and as the system exhausts available physical memory, it resorts to using slower disk swap space, which exacerbates performance issues and accelerates crashes in legacy systems.

## Detection Methods ○

- **Memory Profilers:** Use language-specific memory profiling tools (e.g., Java VisualVM, .NET Memory Profiler, Chrome DevTools Memory tab, Valgrind for C/C++) to analyze heap dumps and track object allocations and references.
- **System Monitoring Tools:** Monitor the application's process memory usage over time using OS-level tools (`top`, `htop`, Task Manager) or APM tools.
- **Load Testing with Long Duration:** Run load tests for extended periods to observe memory growth patterns.
- **Code Review:** Look for common memory leak anti-patterns, especially in areas dealing with event listeners, resource management, or global state.
- **Automated Tests:** Integrate memory usage checks into automated tests, especially for long-running processes.

## Examples
A long-running backend service that processes customer orders gradually consumes more and more RAM. After several days, it crashes. Profiling reveals that a `HashMap` used to cache customer data is never cleared, and new customer entries are continuously added, leading to an unbounded growth in memory. In another case, a single-page application (SPA) allows users to navigate between different views. Each time a user visits a particular view, new event listeners are attached to DOM elements, but the old listeners are never removed when the view is destroyed. Over time, this accumulates thousands of unreferenced DOM nodes and listeners, leading to a significant memory leak and browser slowdown. Memory leaks are particularly problematic in long-running applications, services, or embedded systems. They can be difficult to diagnose because their symptoms often appear gradually and may only manifest after extended periods of operation.
