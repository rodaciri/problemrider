## Description

Mentor burnout occurs when experienced developers become overwhelmed by the constant demands of training, guiding, and supporting newer team members, in addition to their regular development responsibilities. This problem typically arises when knowledge is concentrated in a few individuals who become bottlenecks for knowledge transfer, or when the organization fails to properly structure and distribute mentoring responsibilities across the team.


## Indicators ⟡

- Senior developers spend more time answering questions than writing code
- The same few individuals are constantly being approached for help and guidance
- Experienced team members express frustration about being interrupted frequently
- Mentors start avoiding or delaying responses to help requests
- Senior developers' own productivity and work quality begin to decline

## Detection Methods ○

- **Mentor Time Allocation:** Track how much time experienced developers spend on mentoring versus development work
- **Question Source Analysis:** Monitor who team members go to for help and how frequently
- **Mentor Satisfaction Surveys:** Assess mentor stress levels and satisfaction with their mentoring load
- **Productivity Impact Measurement:** Compare mentors' individual productivity before and after taking on mentoring responsibilities
- **Burnout Risk Assessment:** Use standard burnout assessment tools to evaluate mentor well-being


## Examples

A senior architect at a software company becomes the go-to person for all technical questions about the company's legacy system. As the team grows from 5 to 15 developers, she finds herself answering 20-30 questions per day, spending 60% of her time in mentoring conversations instead of working on critical architecture improvements. Her own work quality begins to suffer, she starts working longer hours to compensate, and she becomes increasingly frustrated with constant interruptions. The situation worsens when management assigns her two additional junior developers to mentor directly, pushing her mentoring responsibilities to over 80% of her time. Eventually, she begins avoiding team communication channels and considering leaving the company due to burnout. Another example involves a database expert who is the only person on the team who understands the complex data migration processes. As the company scales, he spends entire days walking different developers through database procedures, leaving no time for his own responsibilities like performance optimization and schema evolution planning.
