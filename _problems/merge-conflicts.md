## Description

Merge conflicts occur when multiple developers simultaneously modify the same portions of code, creating situations where version control systems cannot automatically reconcile the changes. While occasional conflicts are normal in collaborative development, frequent merge conflicts indicate underlying structural problems with the codebase or development process. These conflicts not only slow down individual developers but also create bottlenecks in the integration process and increase the risk of introducing bugs when resolving conflicts manually.

## Indicators ⟡
- Developers regularly encounter conflicts when pulling or merging changes
- The same files or functions are modified by multiple team members in most commits
- Resolving merge conflicts takes significant time and effort
- Code integration is delayed due to complex conflict resolution
- Developers express frustration about constantly fighting merge conflicts

## Detection Methods ○
- **Version Control Analytics:** Monitor merge conflict frequency and resolution time through git statistics
- **Hotspot Analysis:** Identify files and functions that are modified most frequently across different branches
- **Conflict Resolution Time Tracking:** Measure time spent resolving conflicts versus time spent on actual development
- **Developer Feedback:** Survey team members about their experience with merge conflicts and integration challenges
- **Code Ownership Analysis:** Identify areas where multiple developers regularly make changes simultaneously

## Examples

A web application has a central `UserService` class that handles user authentication, profile management, permissions, notifications, and activity logging. Three developers working on different features all need to modify this class simultaneously - one adding social login, another implementing user preferences, and a third adding audit logging. Every pull request touching this class creates merge conflicts that require careful manual resolution, and the team spends hours each week dealing with conflicts in this single file. Another example involves a configuration management system where all application settings are stored in a single large JSON configuration file. As different team members add new features requiring configuration options, they constantly conflict when trying to add their settings to the same file, requiring manual merging that sometimes results in malformed JSON or missing configuration values.
