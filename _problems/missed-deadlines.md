## Description

Missed deadlines occur when development teams consistently fail to deliver work within agreed-upon timeframes, whether those are sprint goals, release dates, or project milestones. This pattern indicates underlying problems with estimation, planning, execution, or external factors that prevent teams from meeting their commitments. Chronic deadline misses erode stakeholder confidence and can create a cycle of increased pressure and further delays.


## Indicators ⟡

- Sprint goals are consistently not met across multiple iterations
- Project delivery dates are regularly pushed back
- Team velocity is consistently lower than planned capacity
- Stakeholders express frustration about unpredictable delivery timelines
- Teams spend significant time explaining why work took longer than expected


## Symptoms ▲

- [Upstream Timeouts](upstream-timeouts.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.562, Strength: 0.754">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The failure to meet deadlines often results in rushed development and inadequate testing, leading to unstable APIs that do not respond in time, causing upstream services to timeout and further complicating project timelines.
- [Frequent Changes to Requirements](frequent-changes-to-requirements.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.556, Strength: 0.794">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Constant updates to project requirements often arise from teams’ inability to meet deadlines, as stakeholders push for changes to align with evolving business needs, resulting in increased rework and further delays in legacy systems.
- [Developer Frustration and Burnout](developer-frustration-and-burnout.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.541, Strength: 0.772">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Persistent missed deadlines often stem from outdated codebases and inefficient processes, leading to increased pressure on developers, which in turn results in frustration and burnout as they struggle to navigate the complexities and limitations of legacy systems.
- [Unreleased Resources](unreleased-resources.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.486, Strength: 0.755">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The consistent allocation of resources without proper deallocation indicates inadequate time management and prioritization within projects, leading to a buildup of unreleased resources that reflects the teams' inability to meet deadlines and effectively complete their tasks.
- [Reduced Team Productivity](reduced-team-productivity.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.481, Strength: 0.825">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The consistent failure to meet deadlines leads to increased pressure and stress within the team, resulting in decreased productivity as developers struggle to navigate systemic inefficiencies and technical debt inherent in legacy systems.
- [Deadline Pressure](deadline-pressure.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.444, Strength: 0.853">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The consistent failure to meet project timelines creates a culture of urgency that pressures teams to make hasty decisions and prioritize speed over quality, resulting in rushed development practices that further perpetuate the cycle of missed deadlines.
- [Analysis Paralysis](analysis-paralysis.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.416, Strength: 0.819">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The tendency for teams to become mired in extensive research phases, rather than progressing to implementation, indicates a lack of clarity or confidence in project requirements and priorities, which directly contributes to missed deadlines as decisions are delayed and development work stagnates.
- [Stakeholder-Developer Communication Gap](stakeholder-developer-communication-gap.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.399, Strength: 0.818">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  In legacy systems, unclear or ineffective communication between stakeholders and developers often results in misaligned expectations, leading to frequent rework and ultimately causing projects to miss their deadlines.
- [Project Authority Vacuum](project-authority-vacuum.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.371, Strength: 0.788">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The consistent failure to meet deadlines often leads to a lack of executive support and resource allocation, as stakeholders become disengaged and less willing to invest in projects that repeatedly underperform.
- [Inefficient Development Environment](inefficient-development-environment.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.352, Strength: 0.681">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  A slow and cumbersome development environment hinders productivity and efficiency, leading to delays in project tasks and ultimately resulting in consistently missed completion timelines and unmet delivery goals.
- [Stakeholder Dissatisfaction](stakeholder-dissatisfaction.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.339, Strength: 0.831">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Frequent delays in project completion lead to unmet stakeholder expectations regarding timelines and deliverables, resulting in dissatisfaction that reflects the underlying inefficiencies and communication breakdowns typical of legacy systems.
- [Delayed Bug Fixes](delayed-bug-fixes.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.335, Strength: 0.739">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The failure to meet project deadlines often leads to an accumulation of unresolved issues, as teams prioritize new features over bug fixes, resulting in prolonged user frustration and system instability.
- [Reduced Feature Quality](reduced-feature-quality.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.330, Strength: 0.798">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The consistent failure to meet project deadlines forces teams to rush feature development, leading to insufficient time for thorough testing and refinement, which directly results in diminished quality of the delivered features.
- [Team Dysfunction](team-dysfunction.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.305, Strength: 0.803">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Ineffective collaboration stemming from conflicting goals and interpersonal issues leads to a lack of coordinated effort, ultimately resulting in the inability to meet project timelines and delivery commitments.
- [Inconsistent Onboarding Experience](inconsistent-onboarding-experience.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.302, Strength: 0.745">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The inability to meet project deadlines often leads to rushed onboarding processes, resulting in inconsistent guidance and support for new team members, which hinders their integration and productivity within legacy systems.

## Detection Methods ○

- **Sprint Completion Rate Tracking:** Monitor percentage of sprint goals achieved over time
- **Delivery Date Variance Analysis:** Track actual vs. planned delivery dates for projects
- **Velocity Trend Analysis:** Compare planned vs. actual team velocity across sprints
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction Surveys:** Assess business partner confidence in delivery timelines
- **Root Cause Analysis:** Systematically analyze reasons for specific deadline misses


## Examples

A mobile app development team consistently completes only 60% of their planned sprint work, causing feature releases to be delayed by 2-3 sprints on average. Investigation reveals that their estimates don't account for the complexity of testing across multiple device types and operating system versions, and they're frequently interrupted by production support issues that weren't factored into sprint planning. Another example involves a web development team that consistently misses project deadlines because their estimates assume ideal development conditions, but they spend 40% of their time dealing with infrastructure issues, unclear requirements, and dependency delays that weren't accounted for in project planning.
