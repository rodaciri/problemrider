## Description

Deployment Risk occurs when teams deploy systems without having a reliable, tested method to quickly revert to a previous working state when problems arise. This creates significant risk during deployments, as any issues discovered post-deployment can only be resolved by fixing forward, which may take considerable time and cause extended outages. The absence of rollback capabilities often leads to deployment anxiety, longer incident resolution times, and greater impact when deployments go wrong.


## Indicators ⟡

- Deployment procedures that only document forward deployment steps
- Database migration scripts without corresponding rollback scripts
- Infrastructure changes that are difficult or impossible to reverse
- Deployment anxiety and reluctance to deploy during business hours
- Incident response plans that assume fixing forward as the only option
- No testing of rollback procedures during deployment planning
- Configuration changes that overwrite previous settings without backup


## Symptoms ▲

- [Complex Domain Model](complex-domain-model.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.488, Strength: 0.708">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The inherent complexity of the business domain leads to misunderstandings and misimplementations in the software, which increases the likelihood of deployment failures, thereby highlighting the absence of a reliable rollback strategy as a critical risk factor.
- [Frequent Changes to Requirements](frequent-changes-to-requirements.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.474, Strength: 0.686">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Constant updates to project requirements often arise from the lack of a reliable rollback mechanism, as stakeholders feel pressured to adapt to issues that surface post-deployment, leading to increased rework and project delays in legacy systems.
- [Regulatory Compliance Drift](regulatory-compliance-drift.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.437, Strength: 0.741">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of a reliable rollback mechanism in deployment processes leads to hurried updates in legacy systems that prioritize immediate fixes over comprehensive compliance checks, resulting in regulatory standards being neglected and creating costly compliance gaps.
- [Legacy Skill Shortage](legacy-skill-shortage.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.395, Strength: 0.711">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of experienced developers in outdated technologies hampers effective deployment strategies, making it difficult to implement reliable rollback procedures, which in turn heightens the risk associated with new deployments.
- [Review Process Breakdown](review-process-breakdown.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.387, Strength: 0.609">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of a reliable method to revert deployments amplifies the impact of inadequate code review practices, as critical issues go unnoticed and unaddressed, ultimately increasing the likelihood of deployment failures in legacy systems.
- [Data Migration Integrity Issues](data-migration-integrity-issues.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.366, Strength: 0.672">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of a tested rollback method during deployment increases the likelihood of data migration integrity issues, as unverified changes may lead to schema mismatches and format incompatibilities that compromise data consistency and meaning.
- [Reduced Team Productivity](reduced-team-productivity.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.362, Strength: 0.664">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of a tested rollback method for deployments leads to increased anxiety and hesitation within the development team, causing delays and inefficiencies that ultimately reduce overall productivity as they navigate the fear of making irreversible mistakes in the legacy system.
- [Unbounded Data Growth](unbounded-data-growth.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.341, Strength: 0.693">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of a tested rollback mechanism during deployments leads to unbounded data growth as teams may hesitate to revert changes, resulting in an accumulation of unvalidated or erroneous data that further complicates recovery efforts.
- [Flaky Tests](flaky-tests.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.339, Strength: 0.667">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The presence of unreliable tests increases deployment risk by eroding confidence in the testing process, making it difficult to ensure that a deployment is safe and reversible, particularly in legacy systems where dependencies and configurations may not be well-documented or maintained.
- [Monolithic Architecture Constraints](monolithic-architecture-constraints.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.338, Strength: 0.749">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The difficulty in maintaining and scaling large, complex codebases increases the likelihood of deployment failures, as the lack of modularity makes it challenging to isolate and revert changes, thereby underscoring the associated risk of irreversible deployments.
- [Inefficient Development Environment](inefficient-development-environment.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.337, Strength: 0.652">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of a reliable rollback process increases pressure on developers to produce error-free code in a slow and cumbersome development environment, as any deployment failure could lead to significant setbacks, thus reflecting the heightened deployment risk as a symptom of inefficiencies in the development workflow.
- [Rapid Team Growth](rapid-team-growth.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.334, Strength: 0.745">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The rapid expansion of teams without proper preparation exacerbates deployment risk by increasing the volume of changes introduced into the legacy system, making it harder to manage and test rollbacks effectively when issues arise.
- [Analysis Paralysis](analysis-paralysis.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.324, Strength: 0.710">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of a tested rollback method leads teams to overanalyze potential deployment issues, causing delays in decision-making and hindering progress on essential development work.

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○

- Review deployment documentation for rollback procedure coverage
- Audit database migration scripts for presence of rollback/down migrations
- Test rollback procedures in staging environments as part of deployment planning
- Assess infrastructure provisioning tools for state management and rollback capabilities
- Survey deployment teams about confidence in rollback options
- Review incident response procedures for rollback vs. fix-forward decision trees
- Examine deployment tooling for built-in rollback functionality
- Analyze historical incident data for cases where rollback would have reduced impact


## Examples

An e-commerce platform deploys a new payment processing feature during a routine Friday evening release. The deployment includes database schema changes that add new columns and modify existing constraints. Two hours after deployment, customer reports start flooding in about failed payment processing that's blocking orders. The team discovers a critical bug in the new payment logic that affects all transactions. However, they realize they cannot roll back because the database migrations are irreversible - they added required columns that can't be safely removed without data loss. The team is forced to spend the entire weekend debugging and fixing the payment issue in production while the e-commerce site loses revenue from failed transactions. A proper rollback strategy with reversible database changes could have restored service within minutes instead of days.
