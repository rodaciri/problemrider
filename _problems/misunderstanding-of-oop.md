## Description
A misunderstanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) is a common problem in the software industry. It can lead to the creation of poorly designed and difficult-to-maintain code. A misunderstanding of OOP can be caused by a number of factors, such as a lack of training, a lack of experience, or a procedural background. It is a difficult problem to address, but it is important to do so in order to create high-quality software.

## Indicators ⟡
- The codebase is not using inheritance or polymorphism.
- The codebase is full of static methods.
- The codebase is full of utility classes.
- The codebase is difficult to understand and maintain.

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○
- **Code Reviews:** Code reviews are a great way to identify code that is not following object-oriented design principles.
- **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools to identify code that is not following object-oriented design principles.
- **Developer Surveys:** Ask developers about their confidence in their object-oriented design skills.
- **Architectural Assessments:** Conduct an assessment of the system's architecture to identify design flaws.

## Examples
A company has a team of developers who have a misunderstanding of OOP. The team is tasked with building a new web application in an object-oriented language. The team creates a system that is poorly designed and difficult to maintain. The company eventually has to hire a team of experienced object-oriented developers to rewrite the entire system.
