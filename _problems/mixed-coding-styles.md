## Description
Mixed coding styles is a situation where different parts of the codebase use different formatting, naming conventions, and design patterns. This is a common problem in long-running projects, especially those that have been worked on by many different people over the years. Mixed coding styles can lead to a number of problems, including a decrease in readability, an increase in cognitive load, and a general slowdown in development velocity.


## Indicators ⟡
- The codebase is difficult to read and understand.
- There are multiple ways to do the same thing.
- The codebase is a mixture of different styles and conventions.
- There is no style guide for the project, or it exists but is not enforced.

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○
- **Manual Code Inspection:** The inconsistency is often obvious from simply browsing the codebase.
- **Run a Linter or Formatter:** Run a tool like ESLint, Prettier, RuboCop, or Black on the codebase and observe the large number of reported violations.
- **Team Surveys:** Ask developers if they find the codebase easy to read and understand.
- **Analyze Code Review Comments:** Look for a high frequency of comments related to style and formatting.


## Examples
A large enterprise application has been developed by multiple teams over a decade. One module uses camelCase for variables, another uses snake_case, and a third mixes both. Indentation varies between tabs and spaces, and brace styles are inconsistent. This makes it very difficult for any single developer to work across modules efficiently. A new developer joins and submits a pull request that is rejected multiple times due to style violations that were never explicitly communicated, leading to frustration and delays.
