## Description

Monolithic architecture constraints occur when applications are built as single, large codebases that become increasingly difficult to maintain, scale, and deploy as they grow. While monoliths can be appropriate for smaller applications, they create constraints around team autonomy, technology choices, scaling, and deployment flexibility as systems and organizations grow larger.


## Indicators ⟡

- Single codebase contains multiple distinct business domains
- Entire application must be deployed as one unit
- Different parts of application have vastly different scaling requirements
- Multiple teams working on same codebase with frequent conflicts
- Technology stack decisions affect entire application

<br/>  The reluctance to implement changes due to concerns about disrupting existing functionality leads to a stagnation in code evolution, resulting in an increasingly cumbersome and unmanageable codebase that is difficult to maintain and scale.
- [Quality Degradation](quality-degradation.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.306, Strength: 0.674">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  As technical debt accumulates and quality practices falter, the resulting degradation in system reliability and performance complicates maintenance and scaling efforts, ultimately leading to constraints in the monolithic architecture.
- [Avoidance Behaviors](avoidance-behaviors.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.304, Strength: 0.700">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Complex tasks in maintaining and evolving large codebases are often postponed due to the overwhelming cognitive load they present, leading to stagnation and further complicating the already challenging nature of monolithic systems.
- [Project Resource Constraints](project-resource-constraints.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.304, Strength: 0.703">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Insufficient budget and personnel hinder adequate refactoring and modularization efforts, leading to the accumulation of complexity in large codebases that makes maintenance, scaling, and deployment increasingly challenging.
- [God Object Anti-Pattern](god-object-anti-pattern.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.302, Strength: 0.729">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The presence of overly complex classes that manage multiple responsibilities leads to tightly coupled code within large codebases, which in turn hampers maintainability and scalability, ultimately resulting in significant deployment challenges as the system evolves.
- [System Stagnation](system-stagnation.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.302, Strength: 0.688">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  When software systems do not evolve to accommodate new requirements and technologies, they become rigid and overly complex, leading to maintenance challenges and deployment difficulties inherent in large monolithic codebases.

## Detection Methods ○

- **Codebase Size Analysis:** Monitor codebase growth and complexity metrics
- **Deployment Frequency Analysis:** Track how often different parts of application are deployed
- **Team Collaboration Metrics:** Monitor merge conflicts and coordination overhead
- **Build and Test Time Monitoring:** Track build and test execution times over time
- **Scaling Pattern Analysis:** Analyze whether different components have different scaling needs


## Examples

An e-commerce platform started as a simple web application but has grown to include inventory management, order processing, payment handling, customer service, and analytics all in one codebase. The inventory system needs to scale differently than the payment processor, but scaling requires deploying the entire application. When the payment team wants to adopt a new fraud detection library, it affects the entire application build process and requires coordination with all other teams. Deployment of a simple analytics feature requires regression testing the entire platform, slowing down release cycles. Another example involves a content management system that has grown to include user management, content editing, publishing workflows, and reporting. Different teams work on different features but constantly have merge conflicts because they're all modifying the same shared codebase, and a bug in the reporting feature can bring down the entire content editing system.
