## Description

Monolithic functions and classes are code components that have grown to handle multiple, often unrelated responsibilities within a single unit. These "god functions" or "god classes" violate the Single Responsibility Principle and become central points of complexity that are difficult to understand, modify, test, or reuse. They often emerge organically as features are added over time, with developers continuously extending existing functions rather than creating new, focused components.

## Indicators ⟡
- Functions that are hundreds or thousands of lines long
- Classes with dozens of methods and instance variables
- Functions or methods that require extensive scrolling to review completely
- Code that handles multiple distinct business concepts or technical concerns
- Difficulty summarizing what a function or class does in a single sentence

## Symptoms ▲

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Root Causes ▼
- [Procedural Background](procedural-background.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.489, Strength: 0.919">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The tendency to create monolithic functions and classes arises from developers' procedural programming background, as they replicate familiar patterns that prioritize grouped logic over modular design, resulting in tightly coupled and complex code structures in an object-oriented environment.
- [Insufficient Design Skills](insufficient-design-skills.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.448, Strength: 0.912">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The development team's lack of design skills leads to poorly structured code where individual functions and classes accumulate multiple unrelated responsibilities, resulting in a monolithic architecture that is difficult to understand and modify.
- [Poor Encapsulation](poor-encapsulation.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.444, Strength: 0.877">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of cohesive bundling of data with its relevant behavior results in individual functions or classes taking on multiple responsibilities, leading to complex and intertwined code that is harder to understand and modify in legacy systems.
- [Shared Dependencies](shared-dependencies.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.436, Strength: 0.938">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The presence of shared dependencies leads to monolithic functions and classes as developers are compelled to integrate multiple unrelated functionalities into a single component to accommodate the constraints and expectations set by the common libraries and frameworks, resulting in convoluted code that is challenging to maintain and adapt.
- [Tangled Cross-Cutting Concerns](tangled-cross-cutting-concerns.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.435, Strength: 0.907">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The tight coupling of cross-cutting concerns with business logic leads to functions and classes accumulating multiple responsibilities, resulting in complex and monolithic structures that hinder maintainability and understanding in legacy systems.
- [Shared Database](shared-database.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.424, Strength: 0.918">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The reliance on a single database for multiple services leads to tightly coupled functions and classes that must accommodate various data interactions, resulting in bloated and complex code structures that are hard to manage and evolve.
- [Brittle Codebase](brittle-codebase.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.413, Strength: 0.791">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The difficulty in modifying the existing code without introducing new bugs leads to the creation of functions and classes that accumulate multiple, unrelated responsibilities, as developers avoid making changes that could destabilize the system.
- [Misunderstanding of OOP](misunderstanding-of-oop.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.410, Strength: 0.856">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  A lack of understanding of object-oriented principles leads developers to create functions and classes that aggregate multiple, unrelated responsibilities, resulting in complex and unmanageable code structures that are characteristic of legacy systems.
- [Monitoring Gaps](monitoring-gaps.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.409, Strength: 0.841">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Insufficient monitoring and observability hinder the identification of functional overlaps and inefficiencies, leading developers to inadvertently bundle multiple unrelated responsibilities into single functions or classes, thereby exacerbating complexity in the codebase.
- [Tacit Knowledge](tacit-knowledge.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.389, Strength: 0.811">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The accumulation of tacit knowledge among developers leads to monolithic functions and classes as they often embed their understanding of complex requirements and logic directly into the code, resulting in tightly coupled and overly complex structures that are hard to modify or transfer to others.
- [Technology Lock-In](technology-lock-in.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.378, Strength: 0.842">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The difficulty in adopting new technologies often forces developers to maintain and extend existing legacy systems, leading to the accumulation of complex, multifaceted functions and classes that become unwieldy and hard to manage.
- [Organizational Structure Mismatch](organizational-structure-mismatch.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.372, Strength: 0.830">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of alignment between the organization's teams and the system's architecture leads to developers grouping unrelated responsibilities into single functions or classes, resulting in complex, monolithic structures that are challenging to maintain and adapt.
- [Bottleneck Formation](bottleneck-formation.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.368, Strength: 0.817">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The presence of constraints in specific team members or processes leads to rushed development cycles, resulting in the creation of overly complex functions and classes that bundle multiple responsibilities, thus hindering maintainability and clarity in legacy systems.
- [Code Review Inefficiency](code-review-inefficiency.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.364, Strength: 0.793">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Inefficient code reviews lead to inadequate feedback on modularity, allowing developers to continue creating functions and classes with excessive responsibilities, thus perpetuating complexity in the legacy system.
- [Incomplete Projects](incomplete-projects.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.357, Strength: 0.813">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Shifting priorities lead to incomplete features, resulting in developers merging multiple unrelated functionalities into single, monolithic functions and classes to avoid refactoring or incomplete implementations, ultimately complicating maintenance and understanding in legacy systems.
- [Unclear Sharing Expectations](unclear-sharing-expectations.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.356, Strength: 0.824">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Ambiguity in information-sharing leads to poorly defined interfaces and responsibilities, resulting in functions and classes accumulating unrelated tasks to accommodate unclear requirements, thus complicating their modification and understanding in legacy systems.
- [Increasing Brittleness](increasing-brittleness.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.328, Strength: 0.785">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The complexity and interdependence of multiple responsibilities within functions and classes lead to a fragile system where small changes can inadvertently affect unrelated components, thereby increasing the likelihood of errors and making the codebase more difficult to understand and modify.
- [Incomplete Knowledge](incomplete-knowledge.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.325, Strength: 0.772">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of awareness among developers regarding the distribution of similar logic across the codebase leads to the accumulation of unrelated responsibilities within individual functions or classes, making them monolithic and challenging to manage in legacy systems.
- [Bloated Class](bloated-class.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.314, Strength: 0.787">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  A class that has accumulated excessive functionality leads to individual functions becoming overloaded with unrelated responsibilities, making the overall codebase more complex and challenging to modify or understand.
- [Eager to Please Stakeholders](eager-to-please-stakeholders.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.307, Strength: 0.777">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The constant acceptance of stakeholder requests without critical evaluation leads to the accumulation of excessive and unrelated responsibilities within individual functions and classes, resulting in monolithic structures that are overly complex and difficult to maintain.
- [Slow Knowledge Transfer](slow-knowledge-transfer.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.300, Strength: 0.786">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The complexity of overly broad functions and classes hampers new team members' ability to quickly grasp the system's architecture, leading to prolonged knowledge transfer and further entrenching the issues within the legacy codebase.

## Detection Methods ○
- **Code Metrics Tools:** Use static analysis tools to measure function length, cyclomatic complexity, and class size
- **Responsibility Analysis:** Identify functions or classes that handle multiple distinct business or technical concerns
- **Code Review Patterns:** Look for reviews that mention difficulty understanding or testing specific components
- **Change Frequency Analysis:** Components that are modified frequently may be handling too many responsibilities
- **Testing Complexity:** Identify components that require extensive setup or multiple test scenarios

## Examples

An e-commerce application has a single `processOrder` function that handles payment processing, inventory updates, customer notifications, order logging, tax calculations, shipping arrangements, loyalty point updates, and fraud detection. This 800-line function is modified whenever any aspect of order processing changes, making it a constant source of bugs and merge conflicts. Testing this function requires mocking payment systems, databases, email services, and multiple external APIs. When a simple change is needed to the tax calculation logic, developers must understand the entire order processing workflow and risk breaking payment processing or inventory management. Another example involves a `UserManager` class with 45 methods that handles user authentication, profile management, permissions, password reset, email verification, activity logging, and social media integration. Any change to user functionality requires understanding this massive class, and testing individual features like password reset requires initializing the entire user management system.
