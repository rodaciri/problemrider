## Description
A formal change control process is essential for managing the evolution of a project's scope and requirements. Without one, projects are vulnerable to scope creep, where new features and changes are added without proper evaluation of their impact on timelines, budgets, or resources. This can lead to a chaotic development process, missed deadlines, and a final product that does not align with the original vision. A lack of formal change control often stems from a desire to be flexible and responsive, but it ultimately undermines the project's stability and success.


## Indicators ⟡
- The project's scope is constantly expanding.
- The team is frequently missing deadlines.
- The team is constantly context-switching.
- There is a lot of rework.


## Symptoms ▲

- [Frequent Changes to Requirements](frequent-changes-to-requirements.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.535, Strength: 0.767">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The absence of a structured evaluation and approval mechanism for changes allows for ongoing modifications to project requirements, which manifests as frequent updates during development, ultimately leading to increased rework and delays in legacy systems.
- [Product Direction Chaos](product-direction-chaos.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.442, Strength: 0.807">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of a formal process for evaluating and approving changes allows stakeholders to introduce conflicting priorities without accountability, leading to confusion and inefficiency in the development team as they struggle to align on project goals amidst ongoing scope adjustments.
- [Slow Development Velocity](slow-development-velocity.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.300, Strength: 0.649">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of a formal evaluation and approval process for changes leads to frequent, unanticipated alterations in project scope, causing confusion and inefficiencies that slow down development velocity as the team struggles to adapt to shifting requirements without clear guidance.

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○

- **Project Audits:** Review project documentation, meeting minutes, and communication logs to see how changes are being managed.
- **Compare Baselines:** Regularly compare the current project scope and plan against the initial baseline to identify unmanaged deviations.
- **Stakeholder Interviews:** Ask stakeholders and team members about their experience with managing changes and their understanding of the process.
- **Track Rework Metrics:** Monitor the amount of development effort spent on re-implementing or modifying already completed features.


## Examples
A software development project is nearing its release date. A key business stakeholder casually mentions in a hallway conversation that a critical new report is needed before launch. Without a formal change control process, this request is immediately added to the development backlog, causing a significant delay to the release and impacting other planned features. In another case, a team is building a mobile application. Over several months, various product managers and designers send individual emails with new feature ideas or modifications. Without a centralized system to track and approve these, the development team becomes overwhelmed, and the project falls behind schedule with an ever-growing list of unprioritized features. This problem is a common pitfall in project management, especially in organizations that lack maturity in their software development lifecycle. It directly contributes to project failures, budget overruns, and team burnout, and is particularly challenging in legacy modernization efforts where the scope can be inherently fluid.
