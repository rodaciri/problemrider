## Description
Operational overhead is the indirect cost of running a software system. This includes the cost of things like monitoring, logging, alerting, and on-call support. When operational overhead is high, it can be a major drain on the resources of a company. It can also be a major source of stress and frustration for the development team. High operational overhead is often a symptom of a complex and unstable system. It is a sign that the team is spending too much time on reactive work and not enough time on proactive work.


## Indicators ⟡
- The on-call team is constantly being paged.
- The development team is spending a lot of time on operational tasks.
- The cost of monitoring and logging is high.
- There is a general sense of chaos and urgency in the team's daily work.

## Detection Methods ○
- **On-Call Load:** Track the number of pages that the on-call team receives.
- **Time Spent on Operational Tasks:** Track the amount of time that the development team spends on operational tasks.
- **Cost of Monitoring and Logging:** Track the cost of your monitoring and logging tools.
- **Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR):** Measure the average time it takes to resolve a production issue.


## Examples
A company is running a large, distributed system. The system is complex and difficult to understand. The on-call team is constantly being paged to deal with production issues. The development team is spending a lot of time on operational tasks, such as debugging production issues and adding more logging. As a result, the team is making very little progress on new features, and the cost of running the system is high.
