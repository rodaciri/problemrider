## Description
An organizational structure mismatch is a situation where the structure of the organization does not match the architecture of the system. This is a common problem in companies that have a monolithic architecture but are organized into small, autonomous teams. An organizational structure mismatch can lead to a number of problems, including team coordination issues, communication breakdowns, and a slowdown in development velocity.

## Indicators ⟡
- The teams are organized around features, but the architecture is monolithic.
- The teams are constantly stepping on each other's toes.
- There is a lot of duplicated effort.
- It is difficult to get a clear picture of the overall status of the project.

## Symptoms ▲
- **[Team Coordination Issues](team-coordination-issues.md):** The teams have difficulty coordinating their work because they are all working on the same codebase.
- **[Communication Breakdown](communication-breakdown.md):** There is a lack of communication between the teams, which can lead to problems.
- **[Slow Development Velocity](slow-development-velocity.md):** It takes a long time to get things done because of all the coordination overhead.
- **[Developer Frustration and Burnout](developer-frustration-and-burnout.md):** Developers get frustrated with all the coordination issues and the lack of progress.

## Root Causes ▼
- **[Monolithic Architecture Constraints](monolithic-architecture-constraints.md):** The system is designed as a monolith, which makes it difficult for teams to work independently.
- **[Stagnant Architecture](stagnant-architecture.md):** The system does not have a clear architecture, so it is difficult to align the organization with the architecture.
- **[Product Direction Chaos](product-direction-chaos.md):** There is no one on the team who is responsible for making sure that the architecture and the organization are aligned.

## Detection Methods ○
- **Architectural Diagrams:** Create a diagram of the system architecture to identify how the system is structured.
- **Organizational Charts:** Create a chart of the organization to identify how the teams are structured.
- **Developer Surveys:** Ask developers if they feel like they are able to work effectively with other teams.

## Examples
A company has a large, monolithic e-commerce application. The company is organized into a number of small, autonomous teams. Each team is responsible for a different feature of the application. The teams are constantly stepping on each other's toes because they are all working on the same codebase. This leads to a lot of frustration and a slowdown in the pace of development.
