## Description
An over-reliance on utility classes is a common design problem in object-oriented programming. It occurs when a team creates a large number of utility classes with static methods. This can lead to a procedural style of programming and a lack of proper object-oriented design. An over-reliance on utility classes is often a sign of a misunderstanding of the principles of object-oriented programming.


## Indicators ⟡
- The codebase is full of utility classes.
- The codebase is full of static methods.
- The codebase is not using inheritance or polymorphism.
- The codebase is difficult to understand and maintain.

<br/>  The excessive use of utility classes fosters a procedural programming style that results in tightly coupled code, making it increasingly challenging to maintain and scale the growing monolithic codebase, thus serving as an indicator of deeper architectural issues.
- [Inadequate Configuration Management](inadequate-configuration-management.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.423, Strength: 0.913">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The excessive reliance on utility classes often results in tightly coupled, procedural code that makes it difficult to manage and track changes effectively, leading to inadequate configuration management as updates or rollbacks become prone to errors due to the lack of clear object-oriented structures.
- [Inability to Innovate](inability-to-innovate.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.417, Strength: 0.893">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The excessive use of utility classes often leads to a rigid codebase that prioritizes immediate functionality over flexible design, resulting in a maintenance-heavy environment that stifles innovation and leaves little room for exploring new solutions.
- [Undefined Code Style Guidelines](undefined-code-style-guidelines.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.410, Strength: 0.718">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The absence of clear coding standards encourages developers to rely on utility classes for quick fixes, leading to a procedural approach that further perpetuates inconsistent coding practices and hinders the adoption of cohesive object-oriented design in legacy systems.
- [Inadequate Test Data Management](inadequate-test-data-management.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.405, Strength: 0.881">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The excessive use of static methods in utility classes often results in a lack of encapsulation and modularity, making it difficult to create realistic and varied test data, which in turn leads to inadequate testing that fails to capture real-world scenarios.
- [Inefficient Code](inefficient-code.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.392, Strength: 0.872">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Excessive use of utility classes encourages a procedural programming style that often leads to tightly coupled, inefficient code, where the lack of encapsulation and object-oriented principles results in performance bottlenecks and computationally expensive operations.
- [Large Pull Requests](large-pull-requests.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.368, Strength: 0.816">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The over-reliance on utility classes encourages developers to implement extensive procedural logic within static methods, resulting in large pull requests that bundle multiple changes and make it difficult for reviewers to identify individual issues or assess the impact of those changes effectively.
- [Legacy System Documentation Archaeology](legacy-system-documentation-archaeology.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.351, Strength: 0.870">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The excessive reliance on utility classes leads to fragmented and procedural code that is difficult to understand and maintain, resulting in outdated documentation and knowledge gaps as developers struggle to grasp the system's architecture without proper object-oriented context.
- [Team Coordination Issues](team-coordination-issues.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.341, Strength: 0.868">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The over-reliance on utility classes leads to a fragmented codebase with unclear ownership and responsibilities, making it difficult for multiple developers to coordinate effectively, as they struggle to understand and integrate disparate procedural code without a cohesive object-oriented structure.
- [Poor Domain Model](poor-domain-model.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.322, Strength: 0.892">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The excessive reliance on utility classes often results in a procedural design that obscures core business logic, leading to a poorly defined domain model where essential concepts are not accurately represented, thereby indicating a disconnect between the system's structure and its intended functionality.
- [Inconsistent Codebase](inconsistent-codebase.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.310, Strength: 0.870">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The excessive reliance on utility classes encourages a fragmented coding approach that bypasses cohesive object-oriented principles, resulting in an inconsistent codebase that hinders readability and maintainability.
- [Unoptimized File Access](unoptimized-file-access.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.308, Strength: 0.871">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The over-reliance on utility classes often leads to scattered, non-cohesive code that fails to encapsulate data and behavior effectively, resulting in inefficient file handling routines that cause excessive disk I/O and slow performance as developers struggle to manage state and optimize access patterns.
- [Invisible Nature of Technical Debt](invisible-nature-of-technical-debt.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.303, Strength: 0.849">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The excessive reliance on utility classes obscures the complexity and interdependencies of the codebase, leading to technical debt that remains hidden from non-technical stakeholders, making it challenging to justify the need for refactoring or investment in improving the system.

## Detection Methods ○
- **Code Reviews:** Code reviews are a great way to identify an over-reliance on utility classes.
- **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools to identify classes with a large number of static methods.
- **Dependency Analysis:** Analyze the dependencies between the components of the system to identify areas of high coupling.
- **Code Coverage:** Measure the code coverage of your tests. A low code coverage may be a sign of an over-reliance on utility classes.


## Examples
A company has a codebase that is full of utility classes. The classes have names like `StringUtils`, `DateUtils`, and `FileUtils`. The classes contain a large number of static methods. The codebase is difficult to understand and maintain. The company eventually has to hire a team of experienced object-oriented developers to rewrite the entire system.
