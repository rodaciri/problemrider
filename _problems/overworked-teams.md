## Description

Overworked teams consistently operate beyond their sustainable capacity, working excessive hours to meet deadlines or handle overwhelming workloads. This creates a destructive cycle where fatigue leads to mistakes, which require additional work to fix, further increasing the workload. Over time, overwork results in decreased productivity, poor decision-making, health issues, and high turnover as team members seek more sustainable working conditions.

## Indicators ⟡

- Team members regularly work evenings, weekends, or holidays
- Vacation requests are denied or discouraged due to workload pressure
- Quality of work declines despite increased hours worked
- Team members appear exhausted, stressed, or disengaged
- High turnover rate with employees citing workload as a primary reason for leaving

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Developer Frustration and Burnout](developer-frustration-and-burnout.md):** Team members experience chronic exhaustion and decreased motivation
- **[High Turnover](high-turnover.md):** Valuable team members leave for less demanding positions
- **[Increased Error Rates](increased-error-rates.md):** Fatigue leads to more mistakes and oversights
- **[Lower Code Quality](lower-code-quality.md):** Rushed work results in technical debt and poor design decisions
- **[Reduced Innovation](reduced-innovation.md):** No time or energy for creative solutions or process improvements

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Unrealistic Schedule](unrealistic-schedule.md):** Project timelines don't account for realistic work capacity
- **Understaffing:** Team size is insufficient for the amount of work required
- **Poor Resource Planning:** Workload distribution doesn't consider team capacity limits
- **Culture of Overwork:** Organization expects or rewards excessive working hours
- **[Inefficient Processes](inefficient-processes.md):** Unnecessary work and ineffective procedures consume excessive time

## Detection Methods ○

- **Time Tracking Analysis:** Monitor actual hours worked versus standard work weeks
- **Team Health Surveys:** Regular anonymous surveys about workload and stress levels
- **Productivity Trend Analysis:** Track productivity metrics over time to identify decline patterns
- **Turnover Rate Monitoring:** Analyze departure rates and exit interview feedback
- **Quality Metrics Correlation:** Compare defect rates with periods of high workload

## Examples

A development team is asked to deliver three major features simultaneously while also maintaining two legacy systems and providing production support. Team members regularly work 60-80 hour weeks, skip lunch breaks, and cancel personal plans to meet deadlines. Despite the extra hours, productivity actually decreases as exhausted developers make more mistakes that require additional time to fix. Two senior developers quit citing burnout, and their departure further increases workload for remaining team members. The quality of delivered features is poor, requiring extensive rework and customer support. Another example involves a startup where the small engineering team is responsible for developing new features, fixing bugs, managing infrastructure, and handling customer support. The "startup mentality" encourages working nights and weekends as a badge of honor, but after six months, the team is exhausted and making critical errors. A major security vulnerability is introduced due to a tired developer skipping security reviews, resulting in a data breach that damages the company's reputation and requires months of remediation work.
