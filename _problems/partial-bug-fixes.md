## Description
Partial bug fixes are a common problem in software systems with a high degree of code duplication. They occur when a bug is fixed in one instance of the duplicated code, but not in all of them. This can lead to a number of problems, including regression bugs, a loss of trust in the system, and a great deal of frustration for the development team. Partial bug fixes are often a sign of a poorly designed system with a high degree of code duplication.


## Indicators ⟡
- The same bug is reported over and over again.
- The team is constantly fixing regression bugs.
- The team is not sure if a bug has been fixed.
- The team is not able to reproduce bugs that are reported by users.

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○
- **Code Duplication Analysis:** Use static analysis tools to identify duplicated code.
- **Regression Testing:** Use regression testing to verify that bugs that were previously fixed have not reappeared.
- **Code Reviews:** Code reviews are a great way to identify partial bug fixes.
- **Bug Tracking System:** Use a centralized bug tracking system to track the status of bugs.


## Examples
An e-commerce website has a bug in its checkout flow. The bug is fixed in the checkout flow for regular customers, but it is not fixed in the checkout flow for guest customers. As a result, the bug is still present in the system, and it is still affecting users. The problem could have been avoided if the developer who fixed the bug had been aware of the duplicated code and had fixed the bug in both places.
