## Description
Past negative experiences is a situation where developers are hesitant to make changes to the codebase because of negative experiences in the past. This is a common problem in teams that have a brittle codebase and a lack of automated tests. Past negative experiences can lead to a number of problems, including a fear of change, a slowdown in development velocity, and a general sense of stagnation.


## Indicators ⟡

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○
- **Developer Surveys:** Ask developers about their confidence level when making changes to different parts of the system.
- **Change Frequency Analysis:** Monitor how often different modules are modified; consistently avoided areas may indicate fear.
- **Estimation Patterns:** Look for patterns where similar changes have wildly different estimates based on the code area involved.
- **Code Review Comments:** Watch for excessive caution or lengthy discussions about potential risks during code reviews.


## Examples
A developer makes a change to the codebase that causes a major production outage. The developer is blamed for the outage, and they are hesitant to make changes to the codebase in the future. This is a common problem in companies that have a blame culture. It is important to create a culture where it is safe to fail. This will encourage developers to take risks and innovate.
