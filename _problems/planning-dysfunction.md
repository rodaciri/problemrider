## Description

Planning dysfunction occurs when project planning processes systematically produce unrealistic timelines, fail to account for project complexity and risk, or don't effectively coordinate resources and dependencies. This dysfunction manifests as plans that are consistently wrong, overly optimistic, or based on incomplete information about what the project actually requires. The resulting plans create false expectations, resource conflicts, and pressure that ultimately damages both project outcomes and team morale.

## Indicators ⟡

- Project timelines are consistently missed by significant margins
- Planning sessions focus on desired delivery dates rather than realistic effort estimation
- Dependencies between tasks or teams aren't identified during planning
- Risk assessment is superficial or ignored entirely during planning
- Resource conflicts are discovered during execution rather than planning

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Unrealistic Deadlines](unrealistic-deadlines.md):** Project timelines are impossible to meet given available resources and complexity
- **[Resource Allocation Failures](resource-allocation-failures.md):** Required resources aren't available when needed
- **[Scope Creep](scope-creep.md):** Project scope expands because original planning didn't account for full requirements
- **[Competing Priorities](competing-priorities.md):** Multiple projects compete for the same resources due to poor coordination
- **[Time Pressure](time-pressure.md):** Teams work under excessive pressure due to unrealistic plans
- **[Team Demoralization](team-demoralization.md):** Repeated planning failures damage team confidence

## Root Causes ▼

- **Estimation Skill Gaps:** Team lacks experience or techniques for accurate effort estimation
- **Optimism Bias:** Plans consistently underestimate complexity and overestimate team capacity
- **Political Pressure:** Plans are driven by desired dates rather than realistic assessment
- **Incomplete Information:** Planning occurs without sufficient understanding of requirements or constraints
- **Risk Blindness:** Planning process doesn't adequately assess and account for project risks
- **Resource Visibility Problems:** Planners don't have accurate information about resource availability
- **Dependency Complexity:** Interdependencies between tasks and teams aren't properly mapped
- **Historical Data Absence:** No data from previous projects to inform current planning

## Detection Methods ○

- **Plan vs. Actual Analysis:** Compare planned timelines and resource usage with actual results
- **Estimation Accuracy Tracking:** Monitor how close estimates are to actual effort required
- **Resource Utilization Assessment:** Evaluate whether planned resource allocation matches reality
- **Risk Materialization Analysis:** Track how often identified risks actually impact projects
- **Planning Process Effectiveness:** Assess quality and completeness of planning activities
- **Team Confidence Surveys:** Ask team members about their confidence in project plans

## Examples

A software development project is planned with a six-month timeline based on feature complexity estimates, but the planning doesn't account for the fact that the development team will be reduced by 30% due to other project commitments and vacation schedules. The plan also assumes that integration with a third-party service will be straightforward, but this integration actually requires significant custom development that wasn't identified during planning. As a result, the project takes ten months and requires additional resources that weren't budgeted. Another example involves a data migration project where the planning focuses on the technical aspects of moving data but doesn't account for the business process changes required, user training needs, or the time required for data quality validation. The technical migration completes on schedule, but the project is considered a failure because users can't effectively use the migrated system and data quality issues cause business disruption.
