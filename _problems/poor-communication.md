## Description

Poor communication occurs when team members fail to effectively share information, coordinate work, or collaborate on problem-solving. This breakdown in communication can result from various factors including burnout, remote work challenges, personality conflicts, or systemic issues that discourage open dialogue. In software development, poor communication leads to duplicated effort, misaligned solutions, and missed opportunities for knowledge sharing and collective problem-solving.

## Indicators ⟡
- Team members work in isolation rather than collaborating on solutions
- Important decisions are made without consulting relevant stakeholders
- Information about system changes or issues is not shared across the team
- Meetings are unproductive with little meaningful discussion
- Team members frequently discover they've been working on overlapping or conflicting tasks

## Symptoms ▲
- **[Knowledge Silos](knowledge-silos.md):** Critical information becomes trapped with individual team members
- **[Duplicated Research Effort](duplicated-research-effort.md):** Multiple people work on similar problems without coordination
- **Misaligned Solutions:** Team members solve problems in incompatible ways
- **[Review Process Breakdown](review-process-breakdown.md):** Reviews lack meaningful discussion and knowledge transfer
- **[Debugging Difficulties](debugging-difficulties.md):** Issues persist longer because information needed to solve them isn't shared

## Root Causes ▼
- **[Developer Frustration and Burnout](developer-frustration-and-burnout.md):** Burned-out developers withdraw from team interactions
- **Remote Work Challenges:** Distributed teams lack informal communication opportunities
- **Personality Conflicts:** Interpersonal tensions prevent effective collaboration
- **[Time Pressure](time-pressure.md):** Urgent deadlines discourage taking time for proper communication
- **Lack of Communication Tools:** Inadequate platforms or processes for information sharing
- **[Team Silos](team-silos.md):** Team culture doesn't value or encourage open communication

## Detection Methods ○
- **Communication Frequency Analysis:** Monitor how often team members interact on shared tasks
- **Knowledge Sharing Metrics:** Track information sharing through documentation, code reviews, or discussions
- **Team Surveys:** Regular feedback about communication effectiveness and collaboration quality
- **Meeting Effectiveness:** Assess whether team meetings result in meaningful information exchange
- **Issue Resolution Patterns:** Analyze whether problems could have been solved faster with better communication

## Examples

A development team working on a large e-commerce platform has several developers working on different aspects of the checkout process. Due to poor communication, one developer spends two weeks implementing a complex payment validation system while another developer, unaware of this work, creates a different validation approach for the same business requirements. The duplication is only discovered during integration testing, requiring one of the implementations to be discarded and causing significant delays. Additionally, when the payment team encounters a critical bug, they spend days debugging the issue alone instead of asking the team member who originally wrote the affected code and could have identified the problem in minutes. Another example involves a remote team where developers rarely participate in video calls and communicate only through brief text messages. When architectural decisions need to be made, team members make assumptions about requirements instead of discussing them openly. This leads to incompatible implementations that require extensive rework when they're finally integrated. The lack of regular, substantive communication prevents the team from building shared understanding of the system and business requirements.
