## Description

Poor interfaces between applications occur when systems communicate through poorly designed, inconsistent, or inadequately documented integration points. This creates fragile connections that are prone to failures, data inconsistencies, and maintenance challenges. The problem is particularly acute in enterprise environments with multiple legacy systems that evolved independently, requiring complex integration patterns that become increasingly difficult to maintain and extend over time.


## Indicators ⟡

- Integration projects that consistently take longer than estimated
- Multiple different integration patterns used across the same organization
- Lack of standardized API documentation or interface specifications
- Integration logic scattered throughout application codebases rather than centralized
- Frequent discussions about data synchronization issues between systems
- Teams avoiding integration work due to complexity and unreliability
- New system integrations requiring custom, one-off solutions

<br/>  Ineffective bundling of data with its associated behavior creates intertwined dependencies that complicate the definition of clear interfaces, resulting in fragile integrations and inconsistent data across applications.
- [Duplicated Effort](duplicated-effort.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.310, Strength: 0.888">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of coordination among team members leads to multiple independent implementations of interfaces, resulting in inconsistencies and fragile connections between applications in legacy systems.

## Detection Methods ○

- Audit existing integration patterns and identify inconsistencies
- Monitor integration failure rates and error patterns
- Review integration documentation quality and completeness
- Analyze time spent on integration-related maintenance and debugging
- Survey development teams about integration pain points and challenges
- Examine data quality issues that stem from integration problems
- Review system dependency maps for overly complex or fragile connections
- Assess integration testing coverage and reliability


## Examples

A manufacturing company has separate systems for inventory management, order processing, and financial reporting, each developed by different teams over several years. The inventory system exposes data through direct database access, the order system uses REST APIs but with inconsistent error handling, and the financial system expects data via nightly batch file transfers. When an order is processed, inventory updates sometimes fail silently, leading to overselling. Financial reports often show discrepancies because batch transfers occasionally fail without notification. Adding a new customer portal requires integrating with all three systems, but each integration requires different approaches, error handling strategies, and data transformation logic, turning a simple project into a complex, month-long integration effort.
