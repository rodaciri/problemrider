## Description

Poor naming conventions occur when code elements such as variables, functions, classes, modules, and files are given names that fail to clearly communicate their purpose, behavior, or content. This includes names that are too short, too generic, misleading, inconsistent, or use unclear abbreviations. Poor naming forces developers to spend additional mental effort understanding code, increases the likelihood of mistakes, and makes maintenance more difficult.


## Indicators ⟡

- Variable and function names require additional comments to explain their purpose
- Code contains single-letter variables outside of loop counters
- Method names don't clearly indicate what they do or what they return
- Class names are too generic or don't represent clear concepts
- Team members frequently ask about the meaning of specific names during code reviews


## Symptoms ▲

- [Poor Test Coverage](poor-test-coverage.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.480, Strength: 0.696">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  When code elements are poorly named, it becomes difficult for developers to understand their functionality, leading to overlooked areas in testing and resulting in inadequate test coverage.
- [Inefficient Development Environment](inefficient-development-environment.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.470, Strength: 0.754">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The use of unclear naming conventions leads to increased time spent deciphering code, thus hindering efficiency and slowing down the development process in legacy systems.
- [Legacy Skill Shortage](legacy-skill-shortage.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.446, Strength: 0.705">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Poor naming conventions obscure the purpose and functionality of code elements, making it challenging for developers unfamiliar with the system to understand and maintain it, thereby exacerbating the shortage of skilled developers who can effectively navigate and manage legacy technologies.
- [Monolithic Architecture Constraints](monolithic-architecture-constraints.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.421, Strength: 0.784">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Poor naming conventions obscure the intent of code elements, which complicates understanding and collaboration, ultimately leading to a tangled monolithic structure that hinders maintainability and scalability as the codebase evolves.
- [Review Process Breakdown](review-process-breakdown.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.400, Strength: 0.641">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of clear naming conventions hinders reviewers' ability to understand the code's intent, leading to ineffective feedback and a breakdown in the review process that fails to address underlying quality issues.
- [Flaky Tests](flaky-tests.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.390, Strength: 0.751">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Poor naming conventions lead to confusion about the purpose and behavior of code elements, making it difficult to set up tests correctly and understand their dependencies, which in turn results in unreliable test outcomes that undermine confidence in the codebase.
- [Inadequate Test Data Management](inadequate-test-data-management.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.300, Strength: 0.754">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  When code elements are poorly named, it becomes challenging to identify the appropriate context and requirements for creating realistic test data, resulting in inadequate data that fails to simulate genuine scenarios effectively.

## Detection Methods ○

- **Code Review Pattern Analysis:** Track how often naming issues are raised during code reviews
- **Naming Convention Compliance:** Use automated tools to check adherence to naming standards
- **Developer Surveys:** Ask team members about areas where naming makes code difficult to understand
- **Code Comprehension Testing:** Measure how quickly developers can understand code with different naming patterns
- **Name Length and Clarity Analysis:** Analyze the distribution of name lengths and use of abbreviations


## Examples

A payment processing system contains variables like `amt`, `flg`, `tmp`, and `data` throughout the codebase, making it nearly impossible to understand what values they represent without carefully reading surrounding code. A function named `process()` takes 15 parameters and performs validation, transformation, persistence, and notification tasks, but its generic name provides no hint about its complex behavior. In another system, a class called `Manager` handles user authentication, session management, and audit logging - three completely different responsibilities that aren't reflected in its name. The team also uses inconsistent naming patterns: some methods use camelCase while others use snake_case, some boolean variables start with "is" while others start with "has" or "can", and abbreviations are used inconsistently ("num" vs "number" vs "cnt" vs "count"). When a new developer joins the team, they spend the first month constantly asking colleagues to explain what different variables and functions actually do, significantly slowing their productivity and taking time away from other team members.
