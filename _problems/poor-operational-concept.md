## Description

Poor operational concept refers to inadequate planning and preparation for how a system will be monitored, maintained, supported, and operated after it goes live. This problem occurs when development teams focus primarily on building features without sufficient consideration for ongoing operational needs such as logging, monitoring, troubleshooting, backup and recovery, performance tuning, and user support. The result is systems that are difficult to operate reliably and efficiently in production environments.


## Indicators ⟡

- Development planning that focuses exclusively on functional requirements without operational considerations
- No clear definition of operational responsibilities or support procedures before launch
- Missing or inadequate monitoring, logging, and alerting capabilities in system design
- Lack of runbooks, troubleshooting guides, or operational documentation
- No planning for backup, recovery, or disaster recovery scenarios
- Unclear escalation paths or support processes for production issues
- Operations teams not involved in the development and design process

## Detection Methods ○

- Review system architecture and design documents for operational considerations
- Assess availability and quality of monitoring, logging, and alerting capabilities
- Evaluate operational documentation completeness and usability
- Survey operations and support teams about system operability and support challenges
- Analyze incident response times and effectiveness for production issues
- Review backup, recovery, and disaster recovery procedures and testing
- Assess operational automation and tooling availability
- Examine operational cost trends and resource utilization patterns


## Examples

A startup launches their new SaaS platform with comprehensive user features but minimal operational planning. The system has basic logging that only captures application errors, no performance monitoring, and no automated alerting for service degradation. When the platform experiences its first major performance issue during peak usage, the operations team spends hours trying to identify the root cause because they have no visibility into database performance, API response times, or resource utilization patterns. Customer complaints flood in while the team manually checks various system components. The issue eventually resolves itself when usage decreases, but the team never identifies what caused the problem. This pattern repeats weekly, causing customer churn and requiring the team to retrofit monitoring, alerting, and diagnostic capabilities that should have been designed in from the beginning.
