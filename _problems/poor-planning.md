## Description

Poor planning occurs when development projects lack adequate forethought, realistic estimation, risk assessment, or clear execution strategies. This manifests as projects that consistently exceed timeframes, encounter unexpected obstacles, require significant scope changes, or fail to achieve their intended outcomes. Poor planning often stems from inadequate requirements gathering, unrealistic assumptions, or insufficient consideration of technical complexity and dependencies.

## Indicators ⟡

- Projects consistently exceed their original timeline and budget estimates
- Major scope changes or requirement clarifications occur late in development
- Teams discover significant technical obstacles that weren't anticipated
- Resource allocation doesn't match actual project needs
- Dependencies and integration points are identified late in the process

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Missed Deadlines](missed-deadlines.md):** Projects regularly fail to meet their planned delivery dates
- **[Unrealistic Deadlines](unrealistic-deadlines.md):** Planning process produces timeline estimates that prove to be impossible
- **Scope Creep:** Project requirements expand significantly during development
- **Resource Conflicts:** Team members are over-allocated or unavailable when needed
- **Integration Problems:** System integration issues arise because they weren't planned for properly

## Root Causes ▼

- **Inadequate Requirements Gathering:** Insufficient upfront analysis of what needs to be built
- **Estimation Inexperience:** Team lacks skills or experience in accurate effort estimation
- **[Unclear Goals and Priorities](unclear-goals-and-priorities.md):** Project objectives aren't clearly defined before planning begins
- **Risk Assessment Gaps:** Potential obstacles and challenges aren't identified and planned for
- **Dependency Oversight:** External dependencies and integration requirements aren't properly considered
- **Pressure to Commit:** Teams are pressured to provide estimates before proper analysis is complete

## Detection Methods ○

- **Plan vs. Actual Analysis:** Compare planned timelines, budgets, and scope with actual outcomes
- **Estimation Accuracy Tracking:** Monitor how accurate project estimates prove to be over time
- **Change Request Analysis:** Track frequency and magnitude of scope changes during projects
- **Risk Realization Tracking:** Monitor how often unplanned risks materialize during projects
- **Planning Process Review:** Assess the thoroughness and effectiveness of project planning activities

## Examples

A team plans to build a customer dashboard in 8 weeks, but they don't realize until week 6 that the customer data is stored across three different systems with incompatible data formats, requiring a complex data migration that adds 4 weeks to the project. The planning process focused on UI development but didn't adequately investigate the data integration requirements. Another example involves a mobile app project where the team estimates 12 weeks for development but doesn't account for the app store review process, device compatibility testing across 15 different models, or the need to integrate with two third-party services that have different API requirements than initially assumed, ultimately requiring 20 weeks to complete.
