## Description

Poor project control occurs when project management lacks effective mechanisms to track progress, identify risks, and make necessary adjustments. This includes inadequate monitoring of milestones, poor visibility into actual versus planned progress, insufficient risk management, and delayed recognition of problems. Without proper control mechanisms, projects drift away from their intended course, and corrective action is taken too late to be effective.


## Indicators ⟡

- Project status reports are infrequent, superficial, or consistently optimistic
- Actual progress significantly differs from reported progress
- Problems are discovered late when they've become critical
- Project metrics focus on activity rather than outcomes
- Team members have different understanding of project status and priorities

## Detection Methods ○

- **Progress Variance Analysis:** Compare actual progress against planned milestones and budgets
- **Risk Register Review:** Assess whether risks are being identified and managed proactively
- **Communication Effectiveness Assessment:** Evaluate quality and frequency of project communication
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction Surveys:** Gather feedback on project communication and progress visibility
- **Project Health Audits:** Regular independent assessment of project status and control mechanisms


## Examples

A software development project reports "90% complete" for several months running while the team privately acknowledges they're nowhere near done. The project manager focuses on tracking hours worked rather than features completed, and weekly status meetings consist mainly of optimistic updates without discussing blockers or risks. When stakeholders finally demand a demonstration, they discover that core functionality doesn't work and the architecture needs significant rework. The project that was supposed to take six months ends up taking eighteen months and exceeds budget by 200%. Another example involves a system integration project where multiple teams work independently without coordination. The project manager assumes everything is progressing well because each team reports making progress, but no one verifies that the different components will work together. Integration testing begins only two weeks before the planned go-live date, revealing fundamental incompatibilities that require months of additional work to resolve.
