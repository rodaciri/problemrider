## Description

Poor system environment occurs when software systems are deployed to infrastructure that is inadequately configured, unstable, under-resourced, or mismatched to the system's requirements. This can include hardware limitations, network issues, incorrect software configurations, security vulnerabilities, or missing operational tools. A poor environment undermines even well-designed applications and creates ongoing operational challenges.


## Indicators ⟡

- System experiences frequent unexpected outages or crashes
- Performance is significantly worse in production than in development environments
- Deployment and configuration changes often cause system instability
- Infrastructure resources are consistently over or under-utilized
- Operational tasks are more complex and error-prone than necessary

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○

- **System Uptime Monitoring:** Track system availability and identify patterns in outages
- **Performance Benchmarking:** Compare system performance across different environments
- **Resource Utilization Analysis:** Monitor CPU, memory, disk, and network usage patterns
- **Error Rate Tracking:** Measure application errors that can be attributed to environmental issues
- **Deployment Success Rate:** Track the success rate of deployments and correlate with environment factors


## Examples

A legacy financial application is migrated to a cloud environment, but the infrastructure team provisions standard virtual machines without understanding the application's specific requirements for high I/O throughput and low-latency database connections. The result is severe performance degradation, with transaction processing times increasing from seconds to minutes. The application also experiences frequent timeout errors because the default network configuration doesn't account for the complex communication patterns between application components. Another example involves a web application deployed to servers with insufficient memory allocation, causing frequent garbage collection pauses that make the system unresponsive during peak usage periods. The monitoring tools are basic and don't provide visibility into the root causes of performance issues, making troubleshooting extremely difficult.
