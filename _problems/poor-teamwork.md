## Description

Poor teamwork manifests when team members fail to collaborate effectively, work in isolation, or actively resist working together toward common goals. This can include lack of communication, unwillingness to share knowledge, competition instead of collaboration, or personality conflicts that interfere with professional relationships. Poor teamwork reduces the collective capability of the team and prevents the synergistic benefits that come from effective collaboration.

## Indicators ⟡

- Team members consistently work on tasks independently without seeking input
- Knowledge hoarding where individuals don't share important information
- Frequent conflicts or tension between team members
- Decisions are made in isolation without consulting affected colleagues
- Little or no cross-training or knowledge sharing between team members

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Knowledge Silos](knowledge-silos.md):** Important information remains trapped with individual team members
- **[Inconsistent Execution](inconsistent-execution.md):** Different team members approach similar problems in incompatible ways
- **[Team Coordination Issues](team-coordination-issues.md):** Poor coordination leads to duplicated effort or gaps in coverage
- **[Reduced Team Productivity](reduced-team-productivity.md):** Overall team output is less than the sum of individual contributions
- **High Conflict Environment:** Interpersonal conflicts interfere with work progress

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Individual Recognition Culture](individual-recognition-culture.md):** Rewards system emphasizes individual achievement over team success
- **Personality Conflicts:** Incompatible working styles or personal conflicts between team members
- **Competitive Environment:** Team members compete against each other rather than collaborating
- **Poor Team Leadership:** Team leader fails to foster collaboration and resolve conflicts
- **Lack of Shared Goals:** Team members don't understand or commit to common objectives

## Detection Methods ○

- **Team Collaboration Assessment:** Evaluate frequency and quality of team interactions
- **Knowledge Sharing Analysis:** Measure how information flows between team members
- **Conflict Resolution Tracking:** Monitor frequency and resolution of team conflicts
- **Team Performance Metrics:** Compare individual productivity with team collective output
- **Team Health Surveys:** Anonymous feedback about team dynamics and collaboration

## Examples

A development team has five experienced developers who each work on separate modules of a large application. They rarely communicate about their work, use different coding standards, and implement similar functionality in completely different ways. When integration time comes, their modules don't work together because they made incompatible assumptions about data formats and API contracts. Each developer defends their approach and blames others for integration problems, leading to weeks of conflict and rework. Another example involves a team where one senior developer consistently dismisses ideas from junior colleagues, interrupts them in meetings, and refuses to provide code reviews or mentoring. The junior developers become demoralized and stop contributing ideas, while the senior developer becomes a bottleneck because they insist on reviewing and controlling all important decisions. Team productivity suffers because the collective knowledge and creativity of the junior developers is not leveraged, and the senior developer becomes overwhelmed trying to handle everything alone.
