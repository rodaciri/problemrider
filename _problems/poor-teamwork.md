## Description

Poor teamwork manifests when team members fail to collaborate effectively, work in isolation, or actively resist working together toward common goals. This can include lack of communication, unwillingness to share knowledge, competition instead of collaboration, or personality conflicts that interfere with professional relationships. Poor teamwork reduces the collective capability of the team and prevents the synergistic benefits that come from effective collaboration.


## Indicators ⟡

- Team members consistently work on tasks independently without seeking input
- Knowledge hoarding where individuals don't share important information
- Frequent conflicts or tension between team members
- Decisions are made in isolation without consulting affected colleagues
- Little or no cross-training or knowledge sharing between team members

## Detection Methods ○

- **Team Collaboration Assessment:** Evaluate frequency and quality of team interactions
- **Knowledge Sharing Analysis:** Measure how information flows between team members
- **Conflict Resolution Tracking:** Monitor frequency and resolution of team conflicts
- **Team Performance Metrics:** Compare individual productivity with team collective output
- **Team Health Surveys:** Anonymous feedback about team dynamics and collaboration


## Examples

A development team has five experienced developers who each work on separate modules of a large application. They rarely communicate about their work, use different coding standards, and implement similar functionality in completely different ways. When integration time comes, their modules don't work together because they made incompatible assumptions about data formats and API contracts. Each developer defends their approach and blames others for integration problems, leading to weeks of conflict and rework. Another example involves a team where one senior developer consistently dismisses ideas from junior colleagues, interrupts them in meetings, and refuses to provide code reviews or mentoring. The junior developers become demoralized and stop contributing ideas, while the senior developer becomes a bottleneck because they insist on reviewing and controlling all important decisions. Team productivity suffers because the collective knowledge and creativity of the junior developers is not leveraged, and the senior developer becomes overwhelmed trying to handle everything alone.
