## Description

Power struggles occur when different individuals, teams, or departments compete for control, influence, or resources rather than collaborating toward shared organizational goals. These conflicts manifest as territorial disputes, competing visions for project direction, decisions being overruled or undermined, and resources being withheld or redirected based on political considerations rather than project needs. Power struggles waste time and energy while preventing effective decision-making and execution.

## Indicators ⟡

- Decisions are frequently overruled or changed by competing authorities
- Different managers give conflicting directions to the same team members
- Resources or information are withheld to maintain competitive advantage
- Team members receive mixed messages about priorities and objectives
- Important decisions are delayed while different parties vie for control

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Delayed Decision Making](delayed-decision-making.md):** Decisions are postponed while power conflicts are resolved
- **[Team Coordination Issues](team-coordination-issues.md):** Teams receive conflicting directions from different authorities
- **Resource Allocation Conflicts:** Resources are distributed based on politics rather than project needs
- **[Unclear Goals and Priorities](unclear-goals-and-priorities.md):** Competing authorities establish different objectives
- **Reduced Team Morale:** Team becomes frustrated with political conflicts interfering with work

## Root Causes ▼

- **Unclear Authority Structure:** Overlapping or ambiguous decision-making authority
- **Competing Departmental Goals:** Different departments have conflicting objectives
- **Resource Scarcity:** Limited resources create competition between departments
- **Individual Ambition:** Personal career goals override organizational needs
- **Organizational Culture Issues:** Culture rewards political maneuvering over collaboration

## Detection Methods ○

- **Decision Delay Analysis:** Track how long decisions take and identify causes of delays
- **Authority Conflict Tracking:** Monitor instances where decisions are contradicted or overruled
- **Resource Allocation Review:** Assess whether resources are distributed based on objective criteria
- **Team Feedback Collection:** Anonymous surveys about political interference in work
- **Communication Pattern Analysis:** Identify competing messages from different authorities

## Examples

A major system modernization project is simultaneously overseen by the IT department, which wants to maintain control over technical decisions, and the business unit, which wants to drive requirements and timeline. The IT director and business unit manager each assign different priorities to the development team, creating confusion about what to work on first. When the IT director decides to use a specific technology stack, the business manager overrules the decision based on budget concerns, forcing the team to restart technical planning. Team members become frustrated as they receive conflicting guidance and watch weeks of work get discarded due to management disagreements. Another example involves a product development project where the engineering manager and product manager compete for influence over feature priorities. Each tries to build alliances with different team members and stakeholders, creating factions within the team. Important architectural decisions are delayed for weeks while the two managers debate technical approaches, and team members become uncomfortable being caught between competing authorities. The project timeline slips significantly as energy is diverted from productive work to managing political conflicts.
