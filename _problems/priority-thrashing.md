## Description

Priority thrashing occurs when work priorities change so frequently that team members cannot complete tasks before being redirected to different priorities. This creates a chaotic work environment where everything seems urgent, nothing gets completed efficiently, and team members constantly switch between tasks. The result is reduced productivity, increased stress, and difficulty completing any work to a high standard.

## Indicators ⟡

- Team members frequently abandon partially completed work to address new priorities
- Multiple tasks are labeled as "highest priority" simultaneously
- Work priorities change multiple times within a week or sprint
- Team struggles to complete any work items fully before being redirected
- Emergency requests regularly disrupt planned work

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Context Switching Overhead](context-switching-overhead.md):** Constant task switching reduces overall productivity
- **Incomplete Work Items:** Tasks remain partially completed as priorities shift
- **[Increased Stress and Burnout](increased-stress-and-burnout.md):** Constant priority changes create stress and frustration
- **[Quality Degradation](quality-degradation.md):** Work quality suffers due to rushed task switching
- **Planning Breakdown:** Planning becomes meaningless when priorities constantly change

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Unclear Goals and Priorities](unclear-goals-and-priorities.md):** No clear hierarchy or criteria for determining actual priorities
- **Reactive Management:** Management responds to every request as if it's urgent
- **Poor Stakeholder Management:** Multiple stakeholders make competing priority demands
- **Lack of Priority Framework:** No systematic approach to evaluating and ranking priorities
- **Crisis-Driven Culture:** Organization operates in constant crisis mode

## Detection Methods ○

- **Priority Change Frequency:** Track how often work priorities change for the same team
- **Task Completion Rate:** Monitor percentage of started tasks that are completed versus abandoned
- **Context Switch Tracking:** Measure how often team members switch between different types of work
- **Emergency Request Analysis:** Track frequency and impact of urgent requests that disrupt planned work
- **Team Satisfaction Surveys:** Assess team stress levels and satisfaction with work prioritization

## Examples

A development team starts each week with a clear sprint plan, but by Wednesday they've been redirected to three different "critical" issues that all require immediate attention. Team members have four partially completed features, two urgent bug fixes, and a new integration project all competing for their time. Nobody can focus on any single task long enough to complete it properly, and work quality suffers as developers rush between different contexts. Another example involves a support team where every customer request is escalated as urgent, causing the team to constantly switch between different problems without resolving any of them completely. The team's backlog grows because they never have uninterrupted time to work through issues systematically.
