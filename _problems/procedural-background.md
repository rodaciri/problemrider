## Description
A procedural background can be a major obstacle to writing good object-oriented code. Developers who are used to thinking in a procedural way may struggle to adapt to an object-oriented way of thinking. This can lead to the creation of procedural-style code in an object-oriented language, which can be difficult to maintain and evolve. A procedural background is a common problem in the software industry, and it can be difficult to address.


## Indicators ⟡
- The codebase is full of static methods.
- The codebase is full of utility classes.
- The codebase is not using inheritance or polymorphism.
- The codebase is difficult to understand and maintain.

- **Developer Surveys:** Ask developers about their confidence in their object-oriented design skills.
- **Architectural Assessments:** Conduct an assessment of the system's architecture to identify design flaws.


## Examples
A company hires a team of developers who have a background in procedural programming. The team is tasked with building a new web application in an object-oriented language. The team struggles to adapt to an object-oriented way of thinking, and they create a system that is poorly designed and difficult to maintain. The company eventually has to hire a team of experienced object-oriented developers to rewrite the entire system.
