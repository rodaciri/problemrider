## Description

Procedural programming in OOP languages occurs when developers write code using procedural paradigms within object-oriented programming languages, failing to leverage the benefits of object-oriented design principles. This results in code that resembles procedural programs with long sequences of statements, minimal use of classes and objects, and poor encapsulation. While procedural programming has its place, using it inappropriately in object-oriented contexts leads to code that's difficult to maintain, test, and extend.

## Indicators ⟡
- Classes contain primarily static methods with little or no instance state
- Long methods that perform multiple sequential operations without meaningful object interactions
- Data and behavior are separated, with data structures passed between utility methods
- Minimal use of inheritance, polymorphism, or other object-oriented features
- Code resembles a series of utility functions rather than interacting objects

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Root Causes ▼
- [Poor Encapsulation](poor-encapsulation.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.507, Strength: 0.947">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of bundling data with its associated behavior results in developers resorting to procedural coding practices, as they struggle to effectively manage and encapsulate functionality within the constraints of an object-oriented framework, leading to large, monolithic functions that undermine the principles of encapsulation.
- [Procedural Background](procedural-background.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.487, Strength: 0.937">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Developers accustomed to procedural programming often default to familiar coding practices, resulting in monolithic functions and inadequate encapsulation when using object-oriented languages, thus perpetuating legacy issues in software design.
- [Bloated Class](bloated-class.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.460, Strength: 0.837">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The tendency to create large, unwieldy classes results in excessive procedural coding practices, as developers struggle to manage complexity, leading to monolithic functions that defy the principles of encapsulation and modularity.
- [Tangled Cross-Cutting Concerns](tangled-cross-cutting-concerns.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.457, Strength: 0.869">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Tightly coupled cross-cutting concerns force developers to implement procedural coding practices within object-oriented languages, resulting in large, monolithic functions that hinder proper encapsulation and modularity.
- [Insufficient Design Skills](insufficient-design-skills.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.447, Strength: 0.880">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The development team's lack of design skills leads to the implementation of procedural programming practices in object-oriented languages, as they struggle to create appropriate abstractions and modular designs, resulting in monolithic functions that compromise maintainability and encapsulation in legacy systems.
- [Brittle Codebase](brittle-codebase.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.401, Strength: 0.736">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The difficulty in modifying the code without introducing bugs leads developers to revert to procedural programming techniques in order to avoid the risks associated with refactoring, resulting in large, monolithic functions that lack proper encapsulation.
- [Partial Bug Fixes](partial-bug-fixes.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.385, Strength: 0.864">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The tendency to write code in a procedural style stems from applying partial bug fixes to duplicated code fragments, which reinforces monolithic function structures and hinders proper encapsulation in object-oriented programming.
- [Misunderstanding of OOP](misunderstanding-of-oop.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.372, Strength: 0.863">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  A fundamental misunderstanding of object-oriented programming principles leads developers to apply procedural techniques, resulting in monolithic functions that violate encapsulation and hinder maintainability in legacy systems.
- [Incomplete Knowledge](incomplete-knowledge.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.303, Strength: 0.830">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Developers' lack of awareness about the locations of similar logic leads them to write procedural code in an object-oriented context, resulting in large, monolithic functions that compromise encapsulation and maintainability in legacy systems.

## Detection Methods ○
- **Static Method Analysis:** Identify classes with high percentages of static methods relative to instance methods
- **Class Cohesion Metrics:** Measure how well methods and data within classes work together
- **Method Length Analysis:** Look for unusually long methods that perform sequential operations
- **Object Interaction Analysis:** Examine whether objects interact meaningfully or just serve as data containers
- **Design Pattern Usage:** Assess whether code leverages object-oriented design patterns appropriately

## Examples

A Java application for processing customer orders contains a `CustomerOrderProcessor` class with a single static method `processOrder(OrderData orderData)` that is 800 lines long. The method performs validation, inventory checking, payment processing, shipping calculation, email sending, and database updates in a sequential, procedural manner. Instead of creating meaningful objects like `Order`, `PaymentProcessor`, `InventoryManager`, and `ShippingCalculator` that encapsulate behavior and state, all logic is contained in procedural functions that pass data structures between each other. When new order types are added, the entire function must be modified, violating the open-closed principle and making the code increasingly complex. Another example involves a C# content management system where all functionality is implemented in static utility classes like `ContentUtils`, `UserUtils`, and `DatabaseUtils`. These classes contain dozens of static methods that manipulate data transfer objects, but there are no meaningful domain objects that encapsulate business behavior. Adding new content types requires modifications across multiple utility classes, and the lack of polymorphism means extensive if-else statements are used to handle different content types throughout the codebase.
