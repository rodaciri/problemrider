## Description

Product direction chaos occurs when there is no single authoritative voice for product decisions, leaving development teams to navigate conflicting demands from multiple stakeholders. Without clear product leadership, teams receive contradictory requirements, shifting priorities, and ambiguous acceptance criteria. This leads to wasted development effort, delayed releases, and products that fail to meet anyone's actual needs because they try to satisfy everyone's requests simultaneously.

## Indicators ⟡

- Different stakeholders provide conflicting directions and priorities
- The development team frequently asks "who should we listen to?" when receiving competing requests
- Product backlog items lack clear business justification or priority ranking
- Requirements change frequently based on the last stakeholder conversation
- No single person can make definitive decisions about product scope and features

## Detection Methods ○

- **Decision Authority Audit:** Map who currently makes different types of product decisions
- **Requirement Source Analysis:** Track where competing requirements originate and how conflicts are resolved
- **Stakeholder Alignment Assessment:** Survey stakeholders about their understanding of product priorities
- **Backlog Health Check:** Review product backlog for consistency, clear prioritization, and business value articulation
- **Team Surveys:** Ask development team about clarity of requirements and decision-making processes

## Examples

A development team receives a request from the marketing department to add social sharing features, while the operations team demands enhanced security controls, and the sales team insists on integration with a specific CRM system. Each department claims their requirement is the highest priority and must be included in the next release. The team spends weeks in meetings trying to understand how to balance these demands, ultimately building a compromise solution that partially addresses each request but fully satisfies none. The marketing team complains the social features are too limited, operations finds the security insufficient, and sales discovers the CRM integration doesn't support their most important workflows. Another example involves a product backlog where user stories are added by anyone who attends the planning meeting, resulting in a mixture of technical debt items, new features, bug fixes, and infrastructure improvements with no clear business value assessment or priority ranking. The development team struggles to understand what they should work on first.
