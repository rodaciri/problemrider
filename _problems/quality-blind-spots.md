## Description

Quality blind spots occur when testing practices fail to detect critical defects, integration issues, or behavioral problems before they reach production. This creates dangerous gaps in understanding system behavior under various conditions, leading to unexpected failures, user-impacting bugs, and costly production incidents. Unlike having no testing at all, quality blind spots represent systematic weaknesses in what gets tested, how it gets tested, and when testing occurs in the development lifecycle.


## Indicators ⟡

- Production bugs frequently occur in areas that were "tested"
- Critical user journeys fail in production despite passing automated tests
- Integration issues surface only when systems are deployed together
- Performance problems appear under real-world load despite load testing
- Security vulnerabilities exist in code that passed code review and testing

## Detection Methods ○

- **Production Defect Analysis:** Map production issues back to testing coverage gaps
- **Test Coverage Assessment:** Identify areas of code and functionality that lack testing
- **User Journey Testing:** Verify that critical user workflows are thoroughly tested end-to-end
- **Failure Mode Analysis:** Identify what could go wrong and whether those scenarios are tested
- **Test Environment Audit:** Compare testing conditions to production environment characteristics
- **Incident Post-Mortems:** Track whether issues could have been caught by better testing


## Examples

An e-commerce platform has comprehensive unit tests and integration tests that all pass, but their checkout process consistently fails during high-traffic periods because their load testing only simulates average usage patterns, not peak shopping events like Black Friday. The database connection pool exhaustion and payment gateway timeouts that occur under real load were never tested. Another example involves a financial application where all individual microservices are thoroughly tested, but the end-to-end transaction flows fail in production due to timing issues and eventual consistency problems that only manifest when services are deployed across multiple data centers. The integration testing was performed in a single-region environment and didn't account for network latency and partition scenarios.
