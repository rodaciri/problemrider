## Description

Quality compromises occur when teams or organizations deliberately accept lower quality standards, skip quality practices, or take shortcuts to meet immediate constraints such as deadlines, budgets, or resource limitations. While these compromises may provide short-term benefits, they typically create long-term problems including technical debt, increased maintenance costs, and reduced system reliability.

## Indicators ⟡

- Quality practices are skipped or reduced to meet deadlines
- Testing coverage is deliberately reduced to speed delivery
- Code reviews are rushed or bypassed for urgent changes
- Design and architecture decisions prioritize speed over maintainability
- Known quality issues are accepted rather than addressed

## Symptoms ▲
- [Poor Test Coverage](poor-test-coverage.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.510, Strength: 0.744">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Deliberate lowering of quality standards often leads to insufficient testing practices, resulting in critical code segments being left untested and creating significant blind spots in the quality assurance process.
- [Frequent Changes to Requirements](frequent-changes-to-requirements.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.390, Strength: 0.592">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The constant updating of project requirements indicates a reactive response to identified deficiencies in the initial quality, as shortcuts taken during development lead to incomplete or unsatisfactory features that necessitate ongoing adjustments.
- [Flaky Tests](flaky-tests.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.316, Strength: 0.639">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  When quality standards are compromised to meet constraints, it often leads to unstable code and inadequate testing practices, resulting in tests that fail intermittently due to unreliable conditions, thereby eroding confidence in the overall test suite.

## Root Causes ▼
- [Bottleneck Formation](bottleneck-formation.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.431, Strength: 0.887">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  When certain team members or processes become bottlenecks, they force others to rush their work and cut corners in order to maintain deadlines, which ultimately leads to a decline in overall quality and introduces long-term technical debt in legacy systems.
- [Data Migration Complexities](data-migration-complexities.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.349, Strength: 0.811">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Complex data migration processes often lead to rushed implementations and inadequate testing, forcing teams to compromise on quality standards to meet tight deadlines and mitigate the risks of system failures.
- [Project Resource Constraints](project-resource-constraints.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.349, Strength: 0.783">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Insufficient budget and resource allocation due to poor planning lead teams to prioritize meeting deadlines over maintaining quality standards, resulting in compromises that hinder long-term system performance and maintainability.
- [Legal Disputes](legal-disputes.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.330, Strength: 0.831">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Legal disputes over deliverables create pressure to cut corners and compromise quality standards in order to meet contractual obligations and avoid further complications, ultimately leading to long-term systemic issues in legacy systems.
- [Shared Dependencies](shared-dependencies.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.325, Strength: 0.893">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Shared dependencies can lead to quality compromises because when multiple components rely on the same libraries or frameworks, any shortcuts or defects in those shared resources can propagate across the system, forcing teams to lower quality standards to maintain compatibility and meet deadlines.
- [Single Points of Failure](single-points-of-failure.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.319, Strength: 0.767">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  When critical knowledge holders or system components become unavailable, teams are forced to cut corners or lower quality standards to maintain progress, leading to long-term issues in the software's reliability and functionality.

## Detection Methods ○

- **Quality Metrics Tracking:** Monitor trends in code quality, test coverage, and defect rates
- **Process Compliance Monitoring:** Track how often quality processes are skipped or abbreviated
- **Technical Debt Assessment:** Measure accumulation of technical debt over time
- **Team Satisfaction Surveys:** Assess team satisfaction with quality standards and practices
- **Post-Release Quality Analysis:** Evaluate quality issues discovered after deployment

## Examples

A development team facing a critical deadline decides to skip unit testing for new features and reduces code review requirements to single-reviewer approval instead of the usual two reviewers. While this allows them to meet the deadline, the released software contains several bugs that require emergency hotfixes, and the codebase becomes more difficult to maintain due to untested code. Another example involves a project where architectural shortcuts are taken to quickly integrate with a third-party system, creating tight coupling and complex workarounds that make future changes extremely difficult and expensive.
