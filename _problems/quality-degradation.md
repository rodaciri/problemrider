## Description

Quality degradation occurs when software systems experience a steady decline in reliability, maintainability, performance, or usability over time. This degradation typically results from accumulated technical debt, rushed development practices, insufficient testing, and a lack of systematic quality maintenance. Unlike isolated quality issues, this represents a systemic decline that affects multiple aspects of the system.


## Indicators ⟡

- Bug reports increase over time despite ongoing development effort
- System performance gradually decreases without clear cause
- Code becomes increasingly difficult to modify and understand
- User satisfaction with system reliability and usability decreases
- More time is spent on maintenance and bug fixes relative to new features

## Examples

A customer relationship management system that worked well for two years begins experiencing frequent crashes, slow response times, and data inconsistencies. Investigation reveals that rapid feature additions without corresponding refactoring have created a complex, brittle codebase where small changes have unpredictable effects. The team spends 70% of their time fixing bugs and maintaining existing functionality rather than developing new features. Another example involves an e-commerce platform where checkout success rates gradually decline from 99% to 85% over six months due to accumulated integration issues, database performance problems, and unresolved edge cases that compound over time.
