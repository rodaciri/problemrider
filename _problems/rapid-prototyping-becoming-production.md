## Description

Rapid prototyping becoming production occurs when code initially written as a quick prototype, proof-of-concept, or experimental implementation gets deployed to production without being properly engineered for production use. Prototype code typically lacks proper error handling, testing, documentation, security considerations, and scalable architecture because it was designed to demonstrate feasibility rather than serve real users. When this code becomes production software, it creates significant technical debt and reliability issues.

## Indicators ⟡

- Production systems contain code with minimal error handling or validation
- Critical business functions run on code that was originally a "quick test"
- System architecture reflects prototype-level design decisions
- Code comments reference "TODO" items that were never addressed
- Performance and scalability were not considered in system design

## Symptoms ▲
- [Poor Test Coverage](poor-test-coverage.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.499, Strength: 0.719">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of proper engineering practices in quickly developed prototypes leads to insufficient test coverage, as the urgency to deliver functionality often results in overlooking comprehensive quality assurance measures, thereby exposing critical areas of the legacy codebase to undetected issues.

<br/>  The influx of hastily developed code into production systems often leads to complex legacy environments that require specialized knowledge, thereby exacerbating the shortage of skilled developers needed for maintenance and increasing the risk of system failures.
- [Technical Architecture Limitations](technical-architecture-limitations.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.461, Strength: 0.782">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of proper engineering practices in rapidly developed prototypes leads to architectural decisions that are not optimized for long-term performance and scalability, causing inherent limitations that manifest as technical constraints in legacy systems.
- [Slow Development Velocity](slow-development-velocity.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.438, Strength: 0.809">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The inclusion of hastily developed prototype code in production leads to technical debt and increased complexity, which in turn causes frequent issues and inefficiencies that slow down the team's ability to deliver features and fixes at a consistent pace.
- [Lower Code Quality](lower-code-quality.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.406, Strength: 0.700">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The rushed transition of hastily developed prototype code into production environments often leads to insufficient testing and oversight, resulting in lower code quality as developers, under pressure, are more prone to introduce defects and technical debt.
- [Flaky Tests](flaky-tests.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.404, Strength: 0.725">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of rigorous engineering practices in quickly developed code leads to insufficient testing and unreliable dependencies, resulting in tests that fail unpredictably and erode confidence in the system's stability.
- [Inefficient Development Environment](inefficient-development-environment.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.399, Strength: 0.647">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The presence of a slow and cumbersome development environment indicates that hastily developed prototypes are being integrated into production without adequate optimization and engineering practices, leading to inefficiencies that hamper the team's ability to maintain and enhance the system effectively.
- [Monolithic Architecture Constraints](monolithic-architecture-constraints.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.357, Strength: 0.740">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The practice of deploying hastily developed prototype code into production leads to a sprawling monolithic codebase that becomes increasingly unmanageable, as the lack of proper engineering practices prevents effective modularization and scalability.
- [Reduced Individual Productivity](reduced-individual-productivity.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.356, Strength: 0.675">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The presence of poorly-engineered code in production systems leads to increased complexity and technical debt, causing individual developers to spend more time troubleshooting and resolving issues, which ultimately reduces their overall productivity.
- [Frequent Hotfixes and Rollbacks](frequent-hotfixes-and-rollbacks.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.355, Strength: 0.709">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The tendency to deploy hastily developed code directly into production leads to inadequate testing, resulting in a cycle of frequent hotfixes and rollbacks as teams attempt to address the emergent issues stemming from this lack of proper engineering practices.
- [Inadequate Configuration Management](inadequate-configuration-management.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.343, Strength: 0.787">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of proper engineering practices in rapidly developed prototypes often leads to inadequate tracking of code and infrastructure versions, resulting in configuration management failures that manifest as errors and difficulties during deployment in legacy systems.
- [Stakeholder-Developer Communication Gap](stakeholder-developer-communication-gap.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.333, Strength: 0.734">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The hurried development of prototypes without thorough communication leads to misaligned expectations between stakeholders and developers, resulting in dissatisfaction and rework when these inadequately engineered solutions are deployed in production.
- [Technology Isolation](technology-isolation.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.326, Strength: 0.781">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The use of hastily developed code in production leads to outdated practices and technologies, causing the system to drift away from modern stacks and making it difficult to integrate new tools or attract skilled talent.
- [Invisible Nature of Technical Debt](invisible-nature-of-technical-debt.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.313, Strength: 0.772">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The quick transition of prototype code into production often leads to accumulated technical debt that goes unnoticed by non-technical stakeholders, making it difficult to highlight the need for necessary improvements and allocate resources effectively.
- [Inadequate Test Data Management](inadequate-test-data-management.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.309, Strength: 0.769">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The rapid transition of hastily developed code into production often results in a lack of proper test data management, as the focus on speed overlooks the need for realistic and comprehensive test scenarios, leading to insufficient validation of the system's functionality in real-world conditions.

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○

- **Code Quality Analysis:** Analyze production systems for prototype-level code characteristics
- **Architecture Review:** Assess whether system architecture reflects production requirements
- **Error Handling Assessment:** Evaluate robustness of error handling and edge case management
- **Security Audit:** Review security practices and vulnerability exposure
- **Performance Testing:** Test system behavior under production-level loads

## Examples

A development team creates a quick prototype to demonstrate a new customer reporting feature to stakeholders. The prototype uses hardcoded database connections, has no error handling, and pulls data with inefficient queries that work fine for the small test dataset. The demonstration is so successful that management demands the feature be deployed to production immediately. Rather than rebuilding the system properly, the team makes minimal changes to hide the most obvious problems and deploys the prototype code. In production, the system fails when it encounters real customer data that doesn't match the prototype assumptions, causes database performance issues due to inefficient queries, and provides no useful error messages when things go wrong. Another example involves a machine learning prototype that performs well on a small test dataset using a simple Python script. The business is excited by the results and wants to process all customer data through the model. The prototype script is deployed to production with minimal modifications, but it crashes when processing large datasets, has no logging or monitoring, and requires manual restarts when it fails. What started as a successful prototype becomes a maintenance nightmare that requires constant attention from developers.
