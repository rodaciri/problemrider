## Description

Rapid system changes occur when software systems undergo frequent architectural modifications, API updates, configuration changes, or feature additions at a pace that exceeds the team's ability to properly document, test, and understand the implications. While change is necessary for system evolution, when changes happen too quickly without proper coordination and documentation, they create confusion, integration problems, and knowledge gaps that can destabilize the entire system.


## Indicators ⟡

- System undergoes multiple architectural changes within short time periods
- API versions are released faster than clients can adapt
- Configuration changes are made frequently without comprehensive testing
- Team members struggle to keep up with the pace of system modifications
- Documentation consistently lags behind actual system state

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○

- **Change Frequency Analysis:** Track frequency and scope of system modifications over time
- **Documentation Currency Measurement:** Compare documentation dates with actual system changes
- **Integration Stability Monitoring:** Monitor how often existing integrations break due to changes
- **Team Understanding Assessment:** Survey team members about their understanding of current system state
- **Testing Coverage Lag Analysis:** Measure how test coverage changes relative to system modifications


## Examples

A microservices platform undergoes rapid evolution where services are updated multiple times per week, APIs are versioned monthly, and new services are introduced every few weeks. The system's service mesh configuration changes so frequently that the operations team struggles to maintain accurate network policies, and developers frequently encounter broken service dependencies that worked the previous day. Documentation for service interfaces becomes outdated within days of being written, and new team members cannot get reliable information about how services interact. Another example involves a SaaS application where the product team pushes for rapid feature releases to stay competitive. The development team implements new features, modifies existing APIs, and updates database schemas on a weekly basis. Customer integration partners complain that their integrations break frequently due to unexpected API changes, support tickets increase because features behave differently than documented, and the development team spends more time fixing issues caused by rapid changes than implementing new functionality.
