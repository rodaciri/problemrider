## Description

Rapid team growth occurs when development teams expand in size quickly, often doubling or tripling within a short timeframe, without adequate preparation of infrastructure, processes, or support systems. While growth can be positive for meeting increased demands, unmanaged rapid expansion creates significant challenges for knowledge transfer, team coordination, and maintaining code quality standards.

## Indicators ⟡

- Team size increases by more than 50% within a few months
- Multiple new hires start within the same week or month
- Experienced team members are overwhelmed with onboarding duties
- Communication becomes chaotic with too many voices in meetings
- Code review queues become bottlenecked with insufficient senior reviewers

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Mentor Burnout](mentor-burnout.md):** Experienced developers become overwhelmed with training responsibilities for multiple new hires
- **Extended Onboarding Period:** New team members take longer to become productive due to insufficient support
- **[Communication Breakdown](communication-breakdown.md):** Team coordination becomes difficult with rapidly changing team composition
- **[Lower Code Quality](lower-code-quality.md):** Standards drop as review capacity cannot keep pace with increased development output
- **Process Strain:** Existing workflows and tools cannot handle the increased team size effectively

## Root Causes ▼

- **Aggressive Business Growth Targets:** Company expansion requires rapid scaling of development capacity
- **Project Deadline Pressure:** Unrealistic timelines drive hiring of multiple developers simultaneously
- **Poor Growth Planning:** Lack of structured approach to team scaling and capacity building
- **Market Opportunity:** Sudden business opportunities require quick team expansion
- **Competitor Response:** Reaction to competitive pressure leads to rushed hiring decisions

## Detection Methods ○

- **Hiring Velocity Tracking:** Monitor the rate of new team member additions over time
- **Mentor-to-New-Hire Ratio:** Track the ratio of experienced developers to new hires
- **Onboarding Time Analysis:** Measure how onboarding duration changes as team size increases
- **Team Satisfaction Surveys:** Assess how existing team members feel about the pace of growth
- **Process Bottleneck Identification:** Monitor where team processes break down due to increased capacity

## Examples

A startup receives a major round of funding and decides to scale their 8-person engineering team to 20 people within two months. They hire 12 developers simultaneously, including 8 junior developers who all start within the same two-week period. The three senior developers on the team suddenly find themselves responsible for onboarding and mentoring multiple new hires each, spending 80% of their time in training sessions instead of working on critical product features. Code reviews pile up, deployment processes become chaotic, and the team's development velocity actually decreases despite having more people. Another example involves a consulting company that wins three large contracts simultaneously and needs to rapidly scale their development teams. They hire 15 developers across a month, but the company's knowledge management systems, development tools, and project management processes were designed for teams of 5-6 people. The rapid influx overwhelms the existing infrastructure, leading to confusion about roles, responsibilities, and project assignments.
