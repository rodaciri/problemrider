## Description

Rate limiting issues occur when mechanisms designed to control request frequency either block legitimate traffic or fail to effectively prevent abuse and overload. Poor rate limiting configuration can degrade user experience, allow system overload during traffic spikes, or create unfair resource allocation among different types of users or applications.

## Indicators ⟡

- Legitimate users frequently hit rate limits during normal usage
- System becomes overwhelmed despite having rate limiting in place
- Different user types receive unfair access to system resources
- Rate limiting triggers inconsistently across different system components
- Performance issues occur when rate limiting is applied or removed

## Detection Methods ○

- **Rate Limit Hit Analysis:** Monitor frequency and patterns of rate limit violations
- **User Experience Monitoring:** Track user complaints and abandoned sessions due to rate limiting
- **System Load Correlation:** Correlate rate limiting effectiveness with system performance metrics
- **API Usage Pattern Analysis:** Analyze legitimate usage patterns to validate rate limit appropriateness
- **Rate Limiting Algorithm Testing:** Test different rate limiting approaches under various load conditions

## Examples

A social media API uses fixed rate limits of 100 requests per hour for all users, but mobile apps making background sync requests regularly exceed this limit during normal operation, causing sync failures and poor user experience. Analysis shows that legitimate usage varies dramatically by user type - active content creators need much higher limits than casual readers. Implementing tiered rate limiting based on user activity levels and request types resolves the false positive blocks. Another example involves an e-commerce API that applies the same rate limits to product browsing and order placement. During flash sales, the restrictive limits prevent users from completing purchases while still allowing browsing traffic to consume resources. Implementing separate, higher rate limits for transaction endpoints during sales events improves conversion rates while maintaining system protection.
