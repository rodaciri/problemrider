## Description

Reduced review participation occurs when many team members avoid or minimize their involvement in the code review process, leaving most reviews to be handled by a small subset of the team. This creates an uneven distribution of review workload, reduces the diversity of perspectives on code changes, and can lead to review bottlenecks when the active reviewers become overwhelmed or unavailable.


## Indicators ⟡

- Only 2-3 team members out of 8-10 regularly participate in code reviews
- Same individuals are consistently assigned or volunteer for reviews
- Junior developers rarely review senior developers' code
- Some team members go weeks without conducting any reviews
- Review assignments are declined or ignored by certain team members


## Symptoms ▲

- [Poor Test Coverage](poor-test-coverage.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.457, Strength: 0.694">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of diverse input during code reviews leads to critical areas of the codebase being overlooked, resulting in insufficient test coverage and leaving quality assurance vulnerable in legacy systems.
- [Reduced Team Productivity](reduced-team-productivity.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.412, Strength: 0.683">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of diverse input during code reviews leads to lower quality code and undetected issues, which in turn creates additional rework and delays, ultimately reducing the overall productivity of the development team.
- [Inconsistent Onboarding Experience](inconsistent-onboarding-experience.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.359, Strength: 0.833">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of participation in code reviews leads to inconsistent knowledge transfer among team members, resulting in new hires not receiving uniform guidance and support, which ultimately hampers their ability to effectively contribute to the codebase.
- [Inadequate Test Data Management](inadequate-test-data-management.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.325, Strength: 0.730">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of diverse input in code reviews results in a narrow perspective on the code's functionality, leading to inadequate test data management as fewer reviewers fail to identify the need for realistic and comprehensive test scenarios that align with real-world usage.
- [Developer Frustration and Burnout](developer-frustration-and-burnout.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.321, Strength: 0.630">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of diverse input in code reviews leads to increased pressure and workload on a few individuals, fostering frustration and burnout as they struggle to address persistent issues in the legacy codebase without adequate collaboration or support.

## Root Causes ▼

- [Tangled Cross-Cutting Concerns](tangled-cross-cutting-concerns.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.318, Strength: 0.933">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The tightly coupled nature of cross-cutting concerns within legacy systems complicates the review process, leading to increased cognitive load for reviewers and discouraging broader participation as team members feel overwhelmed by the intricacies of both business logic and ancillary functionalities.
- [Procedural Background](procedural-background.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.307, Strength: 0.940">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The struggle of developers with a procedural background to effectively contribute to object-oriented code reviews leads to frustration and disengagement, resulting in reduced participation and an increased burden on a few experienced reviewers.

## Detection Methods ○

- **Review Participation Tracking:** Monitor how many team members actively participate in reviews over time
- **Review Workload Distribution Analysis:** Measure how review responsibilities are distributed across team members  
- **Participation Barrier Surveys:** Collect feedback on why team members avoid reviewing code
- **Review Assignment Acceptance Rates:** Track how often review requests are accepted versus declined
- **Skill Development Impact Assessment:** Evaluate learning outcomes for participating versus non-participating members


## Examples

A 10-person development team has only 3 senior developers who handle 90% of all code reviews, while 7 other team members rarely participate in the review process. When one of the active reviewers goes on vacation, the remaining two become overwhelmed and review quality suffers. The non-participating members miss valuable learning opportunities and remain unaware of coding patterns and design decisions being made across the codebase. Another example involves a team where junior developers feel they're not qualified to review anyone's code, mid-level developers only review other mid-level work, and senior developers review everything. This creates a hierarchy where most code only gets one perspective instead of the diverse viewpoints that make reviews valuable, and junior developers don't develop critical code analysis skills.
