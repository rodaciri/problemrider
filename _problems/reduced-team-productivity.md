## Description

Reduced team productivity occurs when a development team's collective output, efficiency, and effectiveness decline below expected or previous levels. This problem manifests as slower feature delivery, reduced code quality, missed deadlines, and an overall sense that the team is not performing at its potential. Unlike individual productivity issues, this represents a systemic problem affecting the entire team's ability to deliver value consistently.


## Indicators ⟡

- Story points or features completed per sprint consistently decrease over time
- Team estimates become increasingly inaccurate and optimistic
- More time is spent on coordination and overhead than actual development
- Team members frequently wait for others to complete dependencies
- Work-in-progress increases while completed work decreases

## Detection Methods ○

- **Velocity Tracking:** Monitor team velocity trends over multiple sprints or time periods
- **Throughput Analysis:** Measure the ratio of completed work to work in progress
- **Time Allocation Analysis:** Track how team members spend their time between productive work and overhead
- **Blocked Time Tracking:** Measure how much time team members spend waiting for dependencies
- **Team Retrospective Themes:** Identify recurring productivity issues raised in retrospectives


## Examples

A previously high-performing development team that consistently delivered 40 story points per sprint begins completing only 25-30 points per sprint despite no changes in team size or complexity of work. Investigation reveals that team members are spending 30% of their time in coordination meetings, waiting for code reviews, and helping with production issues. The team's technical lead is constantly interrupted with questions, reducing their own productivity while creating bottlenecks for others. Additionally, recent changes to the development environment have made builds 50% slower, and the team lacks expertise in a new technology they're required to use, forcing them to spend significant time researching basic implementation patterns. Another example involves a team where knowledge silos mean that only specific individuals can work on certain parts of the system, creating dependencies and idle time when those experts are unavailable or overloaded.
