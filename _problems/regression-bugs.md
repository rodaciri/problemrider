## Description

Regression bugs are defects that occur when previously working functionality breaks due to new code changes, feature additions, or bug fixes. These bugs represent a significant threat to software quality because they erode user trust and can reintroduce problems that were thought to be resolved. Regression bugs are particularly problematic because they often go undetected until users encounter them in production, and they indicate fundamental issues with testing practices and code maintainability.


## Indicators ⟡
- Users report that features that used to work are now broken
- Previously passing tests start failing after new deployments
- Customer support receives complaints about functionality that worked in previous versions
- Quality assurance frequently discovers that fixing one bug introduces another
- The team regularly discusses whether changes might "break something else"


## Symptoms ▲

- [Poor Test Coverage](poor-test-coverage.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.611, Strength: 0.837">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Insufficient test coverage creates gaps in quality assurance, allowing new changes to inadvertently disrupt previously functioning features without detection, thus leading to regression bugs.
- [Legacy Skill Shortage](legacy-skill-shortage.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.504, Strength: 0.769">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  A critical shortage of developers with expertise in outdated technologies hinders the ability to effectively test and integrate new features, leading to unintentional disruptions of previously stable functionality.
- [Increased Customer Support Load](increased-customer-support-load.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.451, Strength: 0.697">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  When new features or fixes introduce regression bugs in legacy systems, users experience unexpected failures in previously functional tasks, leading to increased frustration and a higher volume of support requests as they seek assistance to resolve these issues.
- [Flaky Tests](flaky-tests.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.337, Strength: 0.627">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Flaky tests often arise in legacy systems due to tightly coupled components and outdated dependencies, which can mask regression bugs by failing unpredictably and making it difficult to determine whether existing functionality has been compromised.

## Root Causes ▼

- [Partial Bug Fixes](partial-bug-fixes.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.444, Strength: 0.903">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Incomplete fixes in duplicated code lead to scenarios where existing functionality fails unexpectedly, as the overlooked instances retain their original defects, resulting in regression when new changes are introduced.
- [Monitoring Gaps](monitoring-gaps.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.394, Strength: 0.875">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Insufficient production monitoring and observability hinder the early detection of unintended side effects from new changes, allowing regression bugs to go unnoticed until they cause significant disruption in legacy systems.
- [Increasing Brittleness](increasing-brittleness.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.370, Strength: 0.836">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  As software systems evolve, the accumulation of outdated code and dependencies leads to increased fragility, where even minor modifications can disrupt interdependent functionalities, resulting in previously stable features breaking unexpectedly.
- [Bikeshedding](bikeshedding.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.340, Strength: 0.874">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Focusing on trivial issues during code reviews diverts attention from critical logic and design flaws, increasing the likelihood that new changes will unintentionally disrupt existing functionality in legacy systems.
- [Large Estimates for Small Changes](large-estimates-for-small-changes.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.339, Strength: 0.859">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The tendency to provide large time estimates for small changes reflects the underlying complexity and fragility of the legacy codebase, leading to increased risk of inadvertently breaking existing functionality when new features or fixes are implemented.
- [Complex Deployment Process](complex-deployment-process.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.336, Strength: 0.816">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The manual and error-prone nature of the software deployment process increases the likelihood of introducing unintended changes during updates, leading to existing functionality breaking as new features are added or fixes are applied.
- [Debugging Difficulties](debugging-difficulties.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.331, Strength: 0.780">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The challenges in identifying and resolving bugs due to a convoluted codebase and insufficient debugging tools lead to unintended consequences where new changes disrupt previously stable functionality, resulting in regression issues.
- [Silent Data Corruption](silent-data-corruption.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.325, Strength: 0.863">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Silent data corruption can lead to erroneous data being used in new features or fixes, causing previously functioning code to fail when it relies on compromised data integrity, thus introducing regression bugs in legacy systems.
- **Large, Risky Releases**
- [Incomplete Projects](incomplete-projects.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.316, Strength: 0.894">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Incomplete projects lead to regression bugs because unfinished features often lack thorough testing and documentation, increasing the likelihood that new code will inadvertently disrupt existing functionality.
- [Manual Deployment Processes](manual-deployment-processes.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.302, Strength: 0.769">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The reliance on manual deployment processes introduces human error and oversight, leading to unintended consequences that disrupt previously stable functionalities during the release of new features or fixes in legacy systems.

## Detection Methods ○
- **Automated Regression Test Suites:** Comprehensive automated tests that verify existing functionality after every change
- **User Acceptance Testing:** Systematic testing of key user workflows before releases
- **Production Monitoring:** Real-time monitoring of system behavior to catch regressions quickly
- **A/B Testing:** Gradual rollouts that can detect regressions before full deployment
- **Bug Categorization:** Track and categorize bugs to identify patterns of regression issues


## Examples

A team adds a new feature to their shopping cart that allows users to save items for later. During implementation, they modify the cart persistence logic to support the new functionality. After deployment, users discover that their cart contents are no longer preserved when they log out and log back in—a core feature that had worked perfectly for years. The regression occurred because the new "save for later" feature changed the data structure used to store cart items, but the existing cart loading logic wasn't updated to handle the new format. The automated tests didn't catch this because they only tested the happy path of the new feature, not the existing cart functionality. Another example involves a banking application where a security patch to prevent SQL injection inadvertently breaks the transaction history display for accounts with certain special characters in their names, causing customer service to be flooded with calls from users who can't access their transaction history.
