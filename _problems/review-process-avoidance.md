## Description

Review process avoidance occurs when team members actively look for ways to bypass, minimize, or circumvent code review requirements due to frustration with the review process itself. This can include making changes directly in production, using emergency deployment procedures for non-urgent changes, committing directly to main branches, or finding technical loopholes to avoid review. This behavior undermines the quality assurance benefits that code reviews are meant to provide.

## Indicators ⟡

- Increased use of "hotfix" or emergency deployment procedures for non-critical changes
- Direct commits to main branches that bypass review requirements
- Changes made during off-hours to avoid review oversight
- Frequent requests to modify review requirements or make exceptions
- Team members express desire to "just skip the review this time"

## Symptoms ▲
- [Poor Test Coverage](poor-test-coverage.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.427, Strength: 0.662">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The tendency to bypass or minimize code review leads to inadequate oversight of the codebase, resulting in critical areas lacking necessary tests and exposing the system to unaddressed quality issues.
- [Inefficient Development Environment](inefficient-development-environment.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.386, Strength: 0.678">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Team members may avoid the code review process due to frustration with a slow development environment, leading them to prioritize speed over quality and consequently undermining the effectiveness of quality assurance measures.
- [Legacy Skill Shortage](legacy-skill-shortage.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.366, Strength: 0.651">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The tendency to bypass code reviews often stems from a lack of confidence in the team's familiarity with legacy technologies, leading to a critical shortage of skilled developers who can effectively navigate and maintain these systems, thus indicating a deeper issue with quality assurance practices.
- [Frequent Changes to Requirements](frequent-changes-to-requirements.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.352, Strength: 0.585">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The tendency to bypass code reviews leads to inadequate validation of evolving requirements, resulting in frequent updates and associated rework, as developers lack the necessary feedback loops to align their work with project expectations.
- [Regulatory Compliance Drift](regulatory-compliance-drift.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.334, Strength: 0.638">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  By bypassing code reviews, team members inadvertently introduce outdated practices and unchecked code changes, leading to a gradual misalignment with regulatory standards that legacy systems must adhere to, thus creating compliance gaps that highlight the consequences of neglecting quality assurance.

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○

- **Review Bypass Tracking:** Monitor commits, deployments, or changes that circumvent normal review processes
- **Emergency Procedure Usage Analysis:** Track frequency and justification of emergency deployment usage
- **Process Compliance Assessment:** Measure what percentage of changes actually go through required review
- **Team Behavior Surveys:** Collect feedback on motivations for avoiding review processes  
- **Quality Impact Correlation:** Analyze whether bypassed changes have higher defect rates

## Examples

A developer becomes frustrated after spending three weeks getting a simple bug fix through the review process due to extensive style debates and conflicting feedback. When they encounter their next urgent bug, they deploy the fix using the emergency hotfix process to avoid review, even though the issue isn't actually critical. This sets a precedent, and soon multiple team members are using emergency procedures for convenience rather than true emergencies. Another example involves a team member who discovers they can make small changes directly in the deployment configuration that bypasses code review requirements. They begin making increasingly significant changes through this route, including business logic modifications that should receive review, because they want to avoid the time and frustration of the normal review process.
