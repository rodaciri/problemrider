## Description

Ripple effect of changes occurs when modifying one component necessitates changes in numerous other components throughout the system, even when those components should logically be independent. This indicates excessive coupling between system parts and poor separation of concerns. The ripple effect makes simple changes expensive and risky, as developers must modify and test multiple areas of the codebase for what should be isolated changes.


## Indicators ⟡
- Simple feature changes require modifications across multiple modules or layers
- Bug fixes in one area break functionality in unrelated areas
- Adding new functionality requires understanding and modifying large portions of the codebase
- Developers regularly say "if we change this, we also need to change X, Y, and Z"
- Impact analysis for changes consistently reveals more affected components than expected


## Symptoms ▲

- [Poor Test Coverage](poor-test-coverage.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.400, Strength: 0.608">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The interdependence of tightly coupled components leads to changes in one area often affecting others, resulting in critical code sections being overlooked during testing, which in turn manifests as insufficient test coverage and increases the risk of undetected issues in the system.
- [Interrupt Overhead](interrupt-overhead.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.390, Strength: 0.778">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Frequent context switches and excessive hardware interrupts arise as a symptom of tightly coupled components in legacy systems, where minor changes necessitate widespread alterations that disrupt the CPU's execution flow, ultimately degrading application performance.
- [Frequent Changes to Requirements](frequent-changes-to-requirements.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.373, Strength: 0.600">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The need for frequent updates to project requirements often arises from the high coupling in legacy systems, where small changes trigger extensive modifications across various interconnected components, resulting in ongoing rework and delays.
- [Complex Domain Model](complex-domain-model.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.346, Strength: 0.572">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The inherent complexity of the business domain leads to tightly coupled components, where a minor change in one area necessitates extensive adjustments in others, thereby highlighting the challenges in understanding and properly implementing the system.
- [Regulatory Compliance Drift](regulatory-compliance-drift.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.309, Strength: 0.570">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The need for extensive modifications across multiple system components due to high coupling can lead to overlooked regulatory updates, resulting in compliance gaps that indicate the system's inability to adapt efficiently to new requirements.

## Root Causes ▼

- [Shared Dependencies](shared-dependencies.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.442, Strength: 0.906">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The requirement for modifications across multiple parts of the system arises because shared libraries and frameworks create tight coupling, where a change in one module can inadvertently affect others that rely on the same dependencies, complicating maintenance and increasing the risk of unintended consequences.
- [Shared Database](shared-database.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.408, Strength: 0.920">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The reliance on a shared database creates tight coupling between components, so that a minor change in one area necessitates adjustments in others to maintain data integrity and consistency, leading to widespread modifications across the system.
- [Procedural Background](procedural-background.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.340, Strength: 0.909">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The tendency of developers trained in procedural programming to write tightly coupled, procedural-style code within an object-oriented framework leads to a lack of modularity, causing small changes in one part of the system to necessitate extensive modifications across many other areas.
- [Tangled Cross-Cutting Concerns](tangled-cross-cutting-concerns.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.304, Strength: 0.838">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The tightly coupled nature of cross-cutting concerns with the business logic in legacy systems forces changes in one area to necessitate modifications in multiple other areas, creating a ripple effect that complicates maintenance and increases the risk of unintended side effects.

## Detection Methods ○
- **Change Impact Analysis:** Track how many files or modules need modification for typical changes
- **Dependency Analysis Tools:** Use static analysis to visualize and measure coupling between components
- **Change Frequency Correlation:** Identify components that frequently change together, indicating coupling
- **Developer Feedback:** Ask developers about the typical scope of changes they need to make
- **Code Review Patterns:** Monitor how often reviews involve discussions about widespread changes


## Examples

An e-commerce system needs to add support for a new payment method. What should be a simple addition to the payment processing module instead requires changes to: the order validation logic (which hardcodes payment types), the user interface (which has payment-specific display logic scattered throughout), the reporting system (which directly queries payment tables), the email notification system (which has payment-specific templates), and the inventory management system (which has different reservation logic for different payment types). A change that should take a few hours ends up requiring two weeks of development and extensive regression testing across the entire application. Another example involves a content management system where adding a new field to user profiles requires modifications to the database schema, user interface components, validation logic, search indexing, export functionality, user migration scripts, API endpoints, mobile app synchronization, and third-party integrations. The ripple effect makes what should be a simple database change into a complex project involving multiple teams and systems.
