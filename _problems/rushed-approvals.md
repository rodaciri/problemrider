## Description

Rushed approvals occur when code reviews are completed hastily without adequate examination of the changes, often due to time pressure, process dysfunction, or cultural issues that prioritize speed over quality. These superficial reviews fail to catch bugs, miss opportunities for knowledge sharing, and allow poor design decisions to accumulate in the codebase. Rushed approvals defeat the primary purposes of code review and can be more harmful than no review at all because they create false confidence in code quality.

## Indicators ⟡
- Pull requests are approved within minutes of submission regardless of size or complexity
- Review comments are minimal or generic ("LGTM", "Ship it") without specific feedback
- Reviews focus only on obvious syntax issues while missing logic or design problems
- Reviewers approve changes in areas of code they're not familiar with
- Review approval times are consistently short across all types of changes

## Symptoms ▲
- [Frequent Changes to Requirements](frequent-changes-to-requirements.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.436, Strength: 0.644">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of thorough examination during rapid approvals leads to overlooked nuances in the requirements, resulting in frequent updates and changes that necessitate rework and trigger delays in legacy systems.
- [Upstream Timeouts](upstream-timeouts.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.433, Strength: 0.619">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of thorough examination in code reviews can lead to the introduction of inefficient or faulty code, which, when deployed, may cause services to time out while waiting for responses from APIs that are not handling requests effectively.
- [Inefficient Development Environment](inefficient-development-environment.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.337, Strength: 0.635">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The slow and cumbersome development environment hinders the team's ability to effectively review code changes, leading to rushed approvals as developers prioritize speed over thoroughness to mitigate delays.
- [Merge Conflicts](merge-conflicts.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.308, Strength: 0.603">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The tendency to quickly approve pull requests without thorough review leads to inadequate coordination among developers, resulting in overlapping changes to the same code areas and subsequently causing frequent version control conflicts.
- [Lower Code Quality](lower-code-quality.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.308, Strength: 0.644">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Quick approvals driven by time constraints lead to insufficient code reviews, resulting in developers overlooking issues and increasing the likelihood of defects in the software.
- [Review Process Breakdown](review-process-breakdown.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.306, Strength: 0.610">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The hurried approval of pull requests leads to a superficial review process that neglects critical assessments and constructive feedback, ultimately resulting in unresolved quality issues within the legacy codebase.

## Detection Methods ○
- **Review Time Analysis:** Track how long reviewers spend examining code relative to change complexity
- **Review Comment Quality:** Analyze the depth and specificity of review feedback
- **Bug Correlation:** Compare bug rates in rushed reviews versus thorough reviews
- **Review Coverage:** Assess whether reviewers examine all changed files and understand the changes
- **Developer Feedback:** Survey team members about review thoroughness and quality

## Examples

A development team is under pressure to release a major feature before a competitor's product launch. Pull requests that normally would require 30-60 minutes of careful review are being approved in 2-3 minutes with comments like "looks good" or "LGTM." A complex pull request implementing new payment processing logic is approved by three reviewers within 5 minutes, despite containing subtle bugs in error handling and edge case management. None of the reviewers took time to understand the payment flow or verify that the implementation correctly handles all the business requirements. The rushed approval allows critical payment bugs to reach production, causing transaction failures and customer complaints that could have been prevented with proper review. Another example involves a security-sensitive authentication module where rushed reviews miss a SQL injection vulnerability because reviewers only glance at the code without tracing the data flow or understanding the security implications. The vulnerability is discovered months later during a security audit, requiring emergency patches and exposing the system to potential attacks that could have been prevented by thorough code review.
