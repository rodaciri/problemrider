## Description

Scope change resistance occurs when organizations or teams avoid making necessary modifications to project scope, requirements, or deliverables due to procedural barriers, contract constraints, or cultural resistance to change. This resistance can prevent projects from adapting to new information, changing business needs, or discovered requirements, potentially leading to delivery of solutions that don't meet actual needs.


## Indicators ⟡

- Necessary changes are identified but not implemented due to process barriers
- Teams continue with original scope despite evidence it won't meet current needs
- Change requests are discouraged or rejected without proper evaluation
- Contract terms prevent adaptation to new requirements or insights
- Stakeholders express concern about scope but changes aren't pursued


## Symptoms ▲

- [Analysis Paralysis](analysis-paralysis.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.366, Strength: 0.762">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Resistance to necessary changes in project scope leads to excessive deliberation and hesitance in decision-making, causing teams to remain stuck in analysis phases without translating insights into actionable development steps.
- [Language Barriers](language-barriers.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.328, Strength: 0.738">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Differences in language or terminology create misunderstandings that complicate discussions around necessary changes, thereby reinforcing resistance to adjusting project scope in legacy systems.
- [Team Dysfunction](team-dysfunction.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.319, Strength: 0.764">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Resistance to necessary changes in project scope often leads to frustration and conflict among team members, as their inability to adapt to evolving requirements fosters dysfunction and hinders effective collaboration.

## Root Causes ▼

- [Budget Overruns](budget-overruns.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.354, Strength: 0.878">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Budget overruns create a fear of additional costs associated with changes, leading stakeholders to resist necessary modifications to project scope in legacy systems due to the perceived financial risks and constraints on available resources.
- [Gold Plating](gold-plating.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.329, Strength: 0.907">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The tendency to add unnecessary features leads to a bloated project scope, which creates a perception of increased risk and complexity, ultimately causing stakeholders to resist necessary changes to the original project requirements.
- [Large Estimates for Small Changes](large-estimates-for-small-changes.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.301, Strength: 0.790">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The tendency to give disproportionately large time estimates for minor modifications reflects the underlying complexity and risk of the legacy code, which fosters a culture of apprehension and reluctance to embrace necessary changes in project scope.

## Detection Methods ○

- **Scope Change Request Analysis:** Track what changes are requested versus what changes are approved
- **Requirement Evolution Tracking:** Monitor how requirements change over project lifecycle
- **Stakeholder Alignment Assessment:** Measure alignment between delivered scope and actual needs
- **Change Approval Rate:** Calculate percentage of proposed changes that are actually implemented
- **Post-Project Reviews:** Assess whether delivered solutions met evolving business needs


## Examples

A customer portal development project discovers through user testing that the original requirements don't match how customers actually want to interact with the system. However, the fixed-price contract makes any scope changes expensive and time-consuming to approve. Rather than adapt the solution to actual user needs, the team continues with the original scope, delivering a system that customers find difficult to use. Another example involves a data migration project where new data quality issues are discovered that weren't in the original scope. The project team avoids addressing these issues because change requests require extensive documentation and approval processes, resulting in a migration that doesn't fully meet data quality requirements.
