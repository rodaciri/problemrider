## Description

Secret management problems occur when applications improperly handle sensitive information like passwords, API keys, certificates, and tokens. Poor secret management practices can lead to credential exposure, security breaches, and operational difficulties when secrets need to be rotated or updated across multiple systems and environments.


## Indicators ⟡

- Secrets hardcoded in source code or configuration files
- Credentials stored in plain text or easily accessible locations
- Same secrets used across multiple environments or applications
- No process for regularly rotating or updating secrets
- Secrets transmitted or logged in plain text


## Symptoms ▲

- [Legacy Skill Shortage](legacy-skill-shortage.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.426, Strength: 0.692">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The inadequate handling of sensitive credentials in legacy systems increases the complexity and risk of maintenance tasks, leading to a reliance on a diminishing pool of specialized developers, which in turn heightens the operational bottlenecks and risks associated with system upkeep.
- [Legacy API Versioning Nightmare](legacy-api-versioning-nightmare.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.383, Strength: 0.866">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Inadequate secret management leads to hard-coded credentials within legacy APIs, resulting in versioning challenges and compatibility issues as updates are hindered by the need to protect sensitive information embedded in outdated interfaces.
- [Inadequate Configuration Management](inadequate-configuration-management.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.382, Strength: 0.922">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The failure to properly manage sensitive credentials often leads to inconsistent configurations across systems, as outdated or incorrect secrets can prevent accurate version tracking and result in deployment errors or complications during rollback processes.
- [Insufficient Audit Logging](insufficient-audit-logging.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.353, Strength: 0.811">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Inadequate handling of sensitive credentials often leads to insufficient logging of security-relevant events, as legacy systems may lack the integration or capability to track access and changes to secrets, making it challenging to identify and respond to security incidents effectively.

## Root Causes ▼

- [Shared Dependencies](shared-dependencies.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.412, Strength: 0.889">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The reliance on shared libraries and frameworks in legacy systems can lead to inconsistent secret management practices across components, making it difficult to enforce proper security measures and increasing the risk of credential exposure.
- **Large, Risky Releases**
- [Hidden Side Effects](hidden-side-effects.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.347, Strength: 0.813">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Undocumented side effects in functions can inadvertently alter or expose sensitive credentials, leading to security vulnerabilities and complicating the management of secrets in legacy systems.
- [Tangled Cross-Cutting Concerns](tangled-cross-cutting-concerns.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.344, Strength: 0.849">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The tight coupling of security mechanisms with business logic in legacy systems prevents effective isolation and management of sensitive credentials, leading to inadequate secret handling and increased security vulnerabilities.
- [Complex Deployment Process](complex-deployment-process.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.342, Strength: 0.809">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The manual and error-prone nature of the deployment process increases the likelihood of misconfigurations and oversights in handling sensitive credentials, thereby exacerbating security vulnerabilities and operational challenges.

## Detection Methods ○

- **Source Code Scanning:** Scan code repositories for hardcoded secrets and credentials
- **Configuration File Auditing:** Review configuration files for plain text secrets
- **Secret Usage Tracking:** Monitor where and how secrets are used across systems
- **Access Control Analysis:** Review who has access to secrets and secret management systems
- **Secret Rotation Testing:** Test secret rotation processes and impact on dependent systems


## Examples

A development team hardcodes database passwords directly in application configuration files that are committed to version control. When the repository is made public or accessed by unauthorized users, all database credentials are exposed. The team discovers that the same hardcoded password is used across development, staging, and production databases, meaning a single credential compromise affects all environments. Another example involves an API integration where third-party service API keys are stored in plain text environment variables and logged during application startup for debugging purposes. The logs containing API keys are stored in centralized logging systems accessible to many employees, effectively giving widespread access to sensitive credentials that could be used to access external services.
