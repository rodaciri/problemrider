## Description

Service discovery failures occur when distributed systems cannot reliably locate and connect to required services, leading to communication breakdowns and system instability. This affects microservices architectures, cloud-native applications, and any system relying on dynamic service registration and discovery mechanisms. Failed service discovery can cascade through dependent services, causing widespread system failures.

## Indicators ⟡

- Services report "service not found" or connection timeout errors
- Intermittent failures in service-to-service communication
- Load balancers cannot route traffic to healthy service instances
- Service registry shows stale or incorrect service information
- Applications cannot bootstrap due to missing service dependencies

## Symptoms ▲
- [Upstream Timeouts](upstream-timeouts.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.653, Strength: 0.882">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  When service discovery mechanisms fail to locate or connect to services, the resulting inability to establish communication leads to prolonged response times, causing upstream services to exceed their configured timeout thresholds and fail as a direct consequence.
- [Flaky Tests](flaky-tests.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.520, Strength: 0.819">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Intermittent failures in service discovery can lead to inconsistent test outcomes, as tests may attempt to connect to unavailable services, thereby reflecting the underlying instability in the system’s communication mechanisms.
- [Legacy API Versioning Nightmare](legacy-api-versioning-nightmare.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.439, Strength: 0.917">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The inability of service discovery mechanisms to effectively locate or connect to services often stems from outdated API designs that lack proper versioning and backward compatibility, making it difficult for systems to communicate reliably, thereby indicating underlying issues in the service discovery process.
- [Stakeholder-Developer Communication Gap](stakeholder-developer-communication-gap.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.418, Strength: 0.809">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Failures in locating or connecting to services often lead to unclear requirements and misalignment between stakeholder expectations and development outputs, as the lack of reliable communication in legacy systems creates confusion and increases the likelihood of rework and dissatisfaction.
- [Cross-System Data Synchronization Problems](cross-system-data-synchronization-problems.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.368, Strength: 0.720">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  When service discovery mechanisms fail to locate or connect to services, it leads to communication breakdowns that hinder effective data exchanges, resulting in inconsistent data states and synchronization challenges between legacy and modern systems.
- [Cascade Delays](cascade-delays.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.325, Strength: 0.888">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Failures in service discovery lead to communication breakdowns that cause critical tasks to be delayed, creating a chain reaction of missed deadlines across dependent projects and teams.
- [Team Dysfunction](team-dysfunction.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.324, Strength: 0.791">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Ineffective communication and coordination among team members arise from the inability to access and connect with services, leading to misaligned efforts and frustration that reflect the underlying failures in the service discovery mechanisms within legacy systems.
- [Stakeholder Dissatisfaction](stakeholder-dissatisfaction.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.312, Strength: 0.812">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  When service discovery mechanisms fail to function properly, it leads to communication breakdowns and delays in development, which in turn frustrates business stakeholders who rely on timely and effective project outcomes.

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○

- **Service Discovery Monitoring:** Monitor service registry health and response times
- **Service Resolution Testing:** Regularly test service name resolution across the system
- **Health Check Validation:** Verify that health checks accurately reflect service status
- **Network Connectivity Testing:** Test network paths between services and discovery infrastructure
- **Registry Consistency Auditing:** Audit service registry data for consistency and accuracy

## Examples

A microservices e-commerce platform uses Consul for service discovery, but network latency causes service registrations to timeout, leaving the registry with stale information. When payment services try to connect to inventory services, they receive outdated IP addresses of terminated instances, causing checkout failures. Implementing retry logic and health check improvements resolves the discovery reliability issues. Another example involves a Kubernetes cluster where DNS-based service discovery fails intermittently due to DNS server overload. Applications experience random connection failures when resolving service names, particularly during high traffic periods. Scaling the DNS infrastructure and implementing DNS caching reduces discovery failures by 95%.
