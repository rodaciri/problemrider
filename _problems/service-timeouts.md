## Description
Service timeouts occur when a service fails to respond to a request within a specified time period. This is a common problem in distributed systems, where services often depend on each other to fulfill requests. Timeouts can be caused by a variety of factors, including network issues, high latency in a downstream service, or a service that is simply overloaded. Properly handling timeouts is crucial for building resilient and reliable systems.


## Indicators ⟡
- You are seeing a high number of timeout errors in your logs.
- Your application is slow, and you suspect that it is due to a high number of timeouts.
- You are getting complaints from users about slow performance.
- Your monitoring system is firing alerts for timeout errors.


## Symptoms ▲

- [Upstream Timeouts](upstream-timeouts.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.495, Strength: 0.687">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  When services fail to complete requests in a timely manner, it leads to upstream services not receiving responses within their set timeout thresholds, indicating an underlying issue with overall service stability and performance.
- [Frequent Changes to Requirements](frequent-changes-to-requirements.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.436, Strength: 0.652">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Constantly updated requirements can lead to service timeouts as developers struggle to accommodate changes within tight deadlines, resulting in rushed implementations that exacerbate performance issues and system instability.
- [Unreleased Resources](unreleased-resources.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.390, Strength: 0.703">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  When requests exceed the allowable service time, the failure to properly release allocated resources can lead to exhaustion of available connections and memory, serving as an indicator of underlying performance issues in the system.
- [Interrupt Overhead](interrupt-overhead.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.349, Strength: 0.779">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Excessive hardware interrupts signal that the system is struggling to manage requests effectively, leading to frequent context switches that exacerbate timeouts and hinder overall application performance in legacy systems.
- [High Defect Rate in Production](high-defect-rate-in-production.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.305, Strength: 0.802">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Frequent service timeouts can lead to rushed fixes and inadequate testing, resulting in a high defect rate in production as developers may overlook critical quality checks while trying to address performance issues.

## Detection Methods ○

- **Distributed Tracing:** Use tools like Jaeger or Zipkin to trace requests across service boundaries and identify which service call is timing out.
- **Log Analysis:** Aggregate and search logs from all services to find timeout error messages and correlate them with other events.
- **Monitoring and Alerting:** Set up alerts on timeout error rates (both client-side and server-side) to detect problems proactively.
- **Chaos Engineering:** Intentionally inject delays or failures into the system to test how it behaves and ensure that timeout and retry mechanisms work as expected.


## Examples
In a microservices-based ordering system, the `Order` service calls the `Payment` service. The `Payment` service is slow, so the `Order` service times out. The user is shown a generic error, but the payment may have actually succeeded, leading to a confusing user experience and inconsistent data. In another case, a web server has a default timeout of 30 seconds. A data-intensive reporting endpoint can sometimes take longer than 30 seconds to generate a report. Users who try to access this report frequently get a 504 Gateway Timeout error. This problem is especially common in complex, distributed systems where a single user request can involve communication between dozens of services. Without careful design of timeouts and retry logic, these systems can be very fragile.
