## Description

Session management issues occur when applications improperly handle user sessions, creating security vulnerabilities that allow attackers to hijack legitimate user sessions, perform session fixation attacks, or exploit weak session lifecycle management. Poor session management can lead to unauthorized access, data theft, and compromise of user accounts.


## Indicators ⟡

- Users can be logged in from multiple locations simultaneously without restriction
- Session tokens remain valid after logout or password changes
- Session identifiers are predictable or insufficiently random
- Sessions don't expire appropriately or have excessive timeouts
- Session data stored insecurely or transmitted without encryption


## Symptoms ▲

- [Unreleased Resources](unreleased-resources.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.346, Strength: 0.687">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Improper session management often leads to the failure to release associated resources, as lingering sessions can prevent timely deallocation of objects and connections, creating opportunities for security vulnerabilities and resource exhaustion in legacy systems.
- [Inadequate Test Data Management](inadequate-test-data-management.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.334, Strength: 0.820">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The presence of unrealistic, outdated, or insufficient test data can lead to overlooked vulnerabilities in session management, as inadequate testing fails to simulate real-world scenarios where session hijacking and fixation risks manifest, thus serving as an indicator of broader security weaknesses in legacy systems.

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○

- **Session Security Testing:** Test session token strength, lifecycle, and security attributes
- **Session Hijacking Simulation:** Attempt to hijack sessions using various attack vectors
- **Session Storage Analysis:** Review how and where session data is stored and transmitted
- **Concurrent Session Testing:** Test behavior with multiple simultaneous sessions
- **Session Timeout and Invalidation Testing:** Verify proper session expiration and cleanup


## Examples

An online banking application generates session tokens using a simple incrementing counter, making session IDs predictable. An attacker can guess valid session tokens by trying sequential numbers and gain access to other users' banking sessions. The application also fails to invalidate sessions when users log out, allowing attackers with access to session tokens to continue using accounts even after legitimate users have logged off. Another example involves an e-commerce site that stores user authentication status in a client-side cookie without encryption or signing. Users can modify the cookie value to change their authentication status or impersonate other users. Additionally, the session cookies lack the Secure flag, allowing them to be transmitted over unencrypted connections where they can be intercepted by attackers.
