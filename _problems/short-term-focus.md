## Description

Short-term focus occurs when organizational decision-making consistently prioritizes immediate deliverables and quick wins over long-term sustainability, code quality, and architectural health. This management approach leads to accumulating technical debt, declining system maintainability, and eventual productivity degradation as the cost of maintaining poorly designed systems increases over time.


## Indicators ⟡

- All development time is allocated to feature delivery with no time for improvement work
- Technical debt and refactoring proposals are consistently rejected or postponed
- Management measures success primarily by feature delivery speed rather than system health
- Long-term architectural planning is minimal or non-existent
- Quality improvement initiatives are seen as non-essential overhead


## Symptoms ▲

- [Reduced Team Productivity](reduced-team-productivity.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.442, Strength: 0.744">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The prioritization of immediate feature delivery leads to technical debt and code rot, which in turn creates systemic inefficiencies that reduce the overall productivity and effectiveness of the development team.
- [Unbounded Data Growth](unbounded-data-growth.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.423, Strength: 0.747">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The prioritization of immediate feature delivery leads to neglect in implementing necessary data management practices, resulting in uncontrolled data growth that signals underlying sustainability issues in the system's architecture.
- [Frequent Changes to Requirements](frequent-changes-to-requirements.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.402, Strength: 0.642">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The prioritization of immediate feature delivery leads to a reactive development environment where requirements are frequently altered in response to urgent needs, resulting in constant rework and highlighting the lack of attention to sustainable code practices.
- [Developer Frustration and Burnout](developer-frustration-and-burnout.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.374, Strength: 0.601">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The prioritization of immediate feature delivery over long-term code health leads to a deteriorating codebase, causing persistent technical debt that frustrates developers and ultimately results in their disengagement and exhaustion.
- [Legacy Skill Shortage](legacy-skill-shortage.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.349, Strength: 0.645">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The prioritization of immediate feature delivery over long-term sustainability leads to insufficient investment in training or hiring developers skilled in legacy technologies, resulting in a critical shortage of expertise that hampers system maintenance and exacerbates existing technical debt.
- [Reduced Innovation](reduced-innovation.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.327, Strength: 0.699">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The prioritization of immediate feature delivery over long-term code health leads to a stagnation in creative problem-solving, as teams become overly focused on meeting short-term goals rather than exploring innovative solutions, resulting in a culture that resists change and limits progress.
- [Technical Architecture Limitations](technical-architecture-limitations.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.301, Strength: 0.668">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The prioritization of immediate feature delivery leads to neglecting necessary architectural improvements, resulting in a constrained system design that hampers performance, scalability, and maintainability, thereby revealing the unsustainable nature of the development approach.

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○

- **Resource Allocation Analysis:** Track percentage of development time spent on improvement vs. new features
- **Technical Debt Trend Analysis:** Monitor whether technical debt is increasing or decreasing over time
- **Development Cost Tracking:** Measure whether development velocity and costs are trending in sustainable directions
- **Management Decision Analysis:** Review how improvement proposals are prioritized vs. feature requests
- **Developer Satisfaction Surveys:** Assess team satisfaction with ability to maintain code quality


## Examples

A software company consistently rejects proposals to modernize their 10-year-old authentication system because it would take 3 months with no immediate customer-visible benefits. Instead, they continue adding feature patches that work around the limitations, spending an estimated 15% of development time on authentication-related workarounds and maintenance. Over two years, this approach costs more development time than the modernization would have required while leaving the fundamental problems unresolved. Another example involves an e-commerce platform where management prioritizes adding new product features every quarter but never allocates time to address performance issues. The site becomes progressively slower, requiring increasingly complex caching strategies and infrastructure spending that ultimately costs more than architectural improvements would have cost.
