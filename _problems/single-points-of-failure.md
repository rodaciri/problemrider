## Description

Single points of failure occur when critical system knowledge, capabilities, or processes depend entirely on individual team members or specific system components. When these individuals are unavailable or when key components fail, entire projects can be blocked, critical issues cannot be resolved, and development progress stops. This creates significant organizational risk and reduces team resilience, making the organization vulnerable to disruption from personnel changes or system failures.


## Indicators ⟡

- Specific team members are essential for certain types of work
- Development stops when key individuals are unavailable
- Critical system components have no backup or redundancy
- Certain problems can only be solved by one person
- Team panics when key personnel are sick or on vacation

<br/>  The reliance on specific knowledge holders within a large, complex codebase increases the risk of critical dependencies, making it difficult to maintain and scale the system efficiently, thereby revealing the underlying issue of single points of failure.
- [Unreleased Resources](unreleased-resources.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.427, Strength: 0.696">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The inability to access critical knowledge holders or components often leads to improper management of system resources, resulting in unreleased allocations that accumulate when processes cannot complete due to halted operations.
- [Reduced Feature Quality](reduced-feature-quality.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.368, Strength: 0.838">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  When specific knowledge holders or components are unavailable, project timelines are compressed, leading to rushed development cycles that sacrifice thorough testing and refinement, ultimately resulting in diminished quality of features delivered to users.
- [Slow Development Velocity](slow-development-velocity.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.364, Strength: 0.795">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The inability to progress due to the unavailability of key knowledge holders or components leads to delays in feature delivery and bug fixes, ultimately causing a decline in overall team productivity.
- [Unmotivated Employees](unmotivated-employees.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.359, Strength: 0.780">ⓘ</span>

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○

- **Bus Factor Analysis:** Identify what would happen if key individuals were unavailable
- **Dependency Mapping:** Chart which work depends on specific people or systems
- **Knowledge Distribution Assessment:** Evaluate how evenly critical knowledge is distributed
- **Availability Impact Tracking:** Monitor how often individual unavailability blocks work
- **Cross-Training Audit:** Assess how many people can perform critical tasks


## Examples

The entire deployment process depends on one senior developer who knows the complex sequence of manual steps, server configurations, and troubleshooting procedures. When they're sick for a week, releases are completely blocked because nobody else understands how to safely deploy the application or fix deployment issues. The team discovers they have no documentation of the deployment process and that attempts by others to deploy result in system failures. Another example involves a legacy database system where only one team member understands the complex data migration scripts and performance tuning procedures. When they leave the company, the team faces a crisis because critical database maintenance tasks can no longer be performed, and new features requiring database changes are blocked indefinitely.
