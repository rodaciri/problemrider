## Description
Slow application performance is a broad problem that can have a wide range of causes, from inefficient code to network latency. It is characterized by an application that is unresponsive, takes a long time to load, or is generally sluggish in its operation. This can lead to a poor user experience, decreased productivity, and ultimately, a loss of users. A systematic approach to performance analysis is required to identify and address the root causes of a slow application.

## Indicators ⟡
- Your application is slow, but your servers are not under heavy load.
- You are getting complaints from users about slow performance.
- Your application is not as responsive as it used to be.
- Your application is using a lot of CPU or memory.

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○

- **Real User Monitoring (RUM):** Use RUM tools to measure the actual performance experienced by users.
- **Application Performance Monitoring (APM):** Use APM tools to trace requests and identify bottlenecks.
- **User Feedback:** Actively collect and analyze user feedback.
- **Browser Developer Tools:** Use the performance and network tabs in browser developer tools to analyze frontend performance.

## Examples
An e-commerce site's product pages take a long time to load, especially on mobile devices. Analysis with RUM tools shows that the page is downloading a large, unoptimized image for each product. In another case, a single-page application (SPA) feels sluggish when navigating between different views. The browser's developer tools reveal that the application is re-rendering the entire page on every navigation, instead of just the parts that have changed. This is a common problem for applications that have grown over time without a focus on performance. As new features are added, the application becomes more complex and slower, until it reaches a tipping point where the performance is unacceptable to users.
