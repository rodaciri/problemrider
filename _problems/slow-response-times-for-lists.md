## Description
Slow response times for lists is a common performance problem in web applications. It occurs when a page or API endpoint that displays a list of items is significantly slower to load than one that displays a single item. This is often a sign of an inefficient data fetching strategy, such as the N+1 query problem. Slow response times for lists can have a major impact on the user experience, and they can be a major source of frustration for users.

## Indicators ⟡
- A page that displays a list of items takes a long time to load.
- The application is making a large number of database queries when it is loading a list of items.
- The application is not using pagination to limit the number of items that are displayed on a single page.
- The application is not using a caching layer.

- [Inefficient Database Indexing](inefficient-database-indexing.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.395, Strength: 0.940">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Slow response times for lists are often caused by the absence of appropriate database indexes, which leads to inefficient data retrieval through full-table scans, thereby significantly increasing load times for queries that return multiple items.
- [Slow Development Velocity](slow-development-velocity.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.380, Strength: 0.940">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Inefficient data fetching for lists leads to prolonged response times, causing developers to spend excessive time troubleshooting and optimizing performance rather than focusing on feature delivery, ultimately reducing overall development velocity.
- [Index Fragmentation](index-fragmentation.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.368, Strength: 0.914">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Inefficient data fetching for lists often stems from disorganized database indexes, where fragmentation impedes the speed of data retrieval, thus serving as an indicator of the slow response times experienced by users.
- [Inefficient Code](inefficient-code.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.365, Strength: 0.912">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Slow response times for lists often stem from inefficient code that fails to optimize data fetching and processing, resulting in excessive computational overhead and performance bottlenecks when handling multiple items simultaneously.
- [Incorrect Max Connection Pool Size](incorrect-max-connection-pool-size.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.349, Strength: 0.903">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Inefficient data fetching for lists can lead to increased demand on the database, causing connection pool exhaustion or resource wastage when the maximum connection pool size is set incorrectly, thus contributing to longer response times.
- [Team Coordination Issues](team-coordination-issues.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.346, Strength: 0.920">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Inefficient data fetching leading to slow load times for lists often results in fragmented team coordination, as developers struggle to optimize shared code and resolve performance bottlenecks, causing confusion and misalignment in their collaborative efforts.

## Detection Methods ○
- **Application Performance Monitoring (APM):** APM tools can often detect and flag slow response times for lists.
- **Browser Developer Tools:** Use the browser developer tools to see how long it takes to load a page.
- **Load Testing:** Use load testing to see how the application behaves under heavy load.
- **Code Review:** During code reviews, specifically look for code that is fetching a list of items from the database.

## Examples
A web application has a page that displays a list of products. The page is very slow to load. The reason for this is that the application is not using pagination, and it is trying to load all of the products in the database at once. The problem could be solved by using pagination to limit the number of products that are displayed on a single page.
