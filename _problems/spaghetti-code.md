## Description

Spaghetti code refers to source code that has become tangled, unstructured, and difficult to follow due to poor organization, excessive use of control structures like goto statements, deeply nested conditionals, and lack of clear separation between different concerns. The code flow jumps around unpredictably, making it extremely difficult to understand the program logic, trace execution paths, or make changes without introducing bugs.


## Indicators ⟡

- Code execution flow is difficult to follow and jumps around unpredictably
- Functions or methods are extremely long with deeply nested control structures
- Global variables are used extensively for communication between different parts
- Code contains many arbitrary jumps, breaks, or continues that disrupt logical flow
- Multiple exit points from functions make it hard to understand return conditions


## Symptoms ▲

- [Complex Domain Model](complex-domain-model.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.495, Strength: 0.738">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Unstructured and tangled code often leads to a convoluted representation of the complex business domain, resulting in a system that becomes increasingly difficult to interpret and implement correctly, thereby highlighting the underlying issues of poor code organization.
- [Legacy Skill Shortage](legacy-skill-shortage.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.495, Strength: 0.739">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The tangled and unstructured nature of the code complicates understanding and maintenance, leading to a reliance on a shrinking pool of developers who possess the necessary legacy knowledge, thereby creating a bottleneck in system upkeep.
- [Poor Test Coverage](poor-test-coverage.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.482, Strength: 0.708">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The tangled and unstructured nature of the code makes it difficult to identify which parts require testing, leading to significant gaps in test coverage that expose critical areas to undetected bugs and failures.
- [Unbounded Data Growth](unbounded-data-growth.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.428, Strength: 0.723">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Tangled and unstructured logic in legacy code makes it difficult to implement effective data management practices, leading to uncontrolled growth of data structures and databases as developers struggle to modify or optimize the existing codebase.
- [Flaky Tests](flaky-tests.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.399, Strength: 0.710">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Unstructured logic leads to unpredictable interactions and dependencies within the code, causing tests to fail intermittently and eroding confidence in the reliability of the test suite.
- [Unbounded Data Structures](unbounded-data-structures.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.374, Strength: 0.638">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The tangled and unstructured logic of poorly organized code can lead to improper management of data structures, resulting in them growing indefinitely without constraints, thereby indicating the presence of underlying code quality issues.
- [Inadequate Mentoring Structure](inadequate-mentoring-structure.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.355, Strength: 0.771">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The tangled and unstructured nature of the code makes it difficult for new developers to grasp the system's logic without proper mentorship, resulting in a lack of consistent guidance that highlights the need for better support structures.
- [Inconsistent Naming Conventions](inconsistent-naming-conventions.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.352, Strength: 0.697">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  In legacy systems, unstructured and tangled logic often leads developers to adopt inconsistent naming conventions, as the lack of clear organization makes it difficult to maintain coherent and meaningful identifiers, thereby serving as an indicator of deeper code quality issues.
- [Lower Code Quality](lower-code-quality.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.326, Strength: 0.640">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Tangled and unstructured logic within the code creates an environment where developers, feeling overwhelmed and pressed for time, are more prone to making mistakes, resulting in a noticeable decline in code quality as they struggle to navigate and implement changes effectively.
- [Poor Project Control](poor-project-control.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.304, Strength: 0.774">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of effective monitoring in a project leads to undetected complexities and issues within tangled, unstructured code, making it difficult to assess progress and identify problems until they escalate beyond control.
- [Technical Architecture Limitations](technical-architecture-limitations.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.304, Strength: 0.769">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Tangled and unstructured logic in the codebase leads to poor architectural decisions, which in turn creates constraints that hinder the system's performance, scalability, and maintainability, making it a clear indicator of underlying design flaws.

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○

- **Cyclomatic Complexity Analysis:** Use tools to measure code complexity and identify tangled methods
- **Control Flow Visualization:** Create diagrams showing code execution paths to identify spaghetti patterns
- **Code Metrics Assessment:** Track function length, nesting depth, and number of exit points
- **Developer Feedback:** Survey team members about areas of code that are difficult to understand
- **Bug Density Analysis:** Identify code areas with high bug rates that may indicate spaghetti structure


## Examples

A legacy e-commerce system has a checkout process implemented as a single 2000-line function with 15 levels of nested if-statements, multiple goto statements jumping to different parts of the function, and global variables tracking state changes throughout the process. The function handles payment processing, inventory updates, shipping calculations, tax computation, and email notifications all in one tangled mess. When a bug is reported in the tax calculation, developers spend days tracing through the code to understand which path leads to the problem, and fixing it risks breaking payment processing or inventory management. Another example involves a reporting system where data processing logic is scattered across multiple functions that call each other in unpredictable ways, using global variables to pass data between different processing stages. A simple change to add a new data field requires understanding and modifying seven different functions, each with its own complex control flow and side effects.
