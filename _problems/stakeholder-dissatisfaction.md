## Description

Stakeholder dissatisfaction occurs when business stakeholders, executives, or project sponsors become unhappy with various aspects of software development projects, including delivered outcomes, development speed, communication quality, or overall project management. This dissatisfaction can lead to reduced support for development initiatives, budget cuts, team changes, or project cancellations. Addressing stakeholder concerns is crucial for project success and organizational relationships.


## Indicators ⟡

- Stakeholders express frustration or disappointment in meetings or communications
- Questions about project value, timeline, or approach become more frequent
- Stakeholder engagement in project activities decreases over time
- Funding or resource allocation for projects becomes more difficult to obtain
- Management begins investigating alternative approaches or vendors

## Detection Methods ○

- **Stakeholder Satisfaction Surveys:** Regular assessment of stakeholder satisfaction with project progress
- **Meeting Tone Analysis:** Monitor tone and content of stakeholder communications and meetings
- **Engagement Level Tracking:** Measure stakeholder participation in project activities over time
- **Feedback Frequency Assessment:** Track frequency and nature of stakeholder feedback and concerns
- **Support Level Indicators:** Monitor signs of changing stakeholder support for project initiatives


## Examples

A development team builds a customer portal based on initial requirements, but when they demo the system after three months of work, business stakeholders reveal that their priorities have changed and they now need a mobile-first solution rather than a desktop-focused portal. The stakeholders become frustrated that the development team didn't check in about changing business needs and view the desktop portal as wasted effort. Trust between the teams deteriorates as stakeholders question whether the development team understands the business. Another example involves a project where the development team consistently misses sprint commitments and provides optimistic estimates that prove unrealistic. Stakeholders lose confidence in the team's ability to deliver on promises and begin looking for alternative development approaches or vendors, viewing the internal team as unreliable despite their technical competence.
