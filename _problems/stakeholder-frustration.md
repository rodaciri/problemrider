## Description

Stakeholder frustration occurs when business stakeholders become dissatisfied with the development team's performance, communication, or deliverables. This frustration typically builds over time due to unmet expectations, poor communication, missed deadlines, or quality issues. Frustrated stakeholders may reduce their support for projects, bypass development teams, or escalate concerns to higher management.


## Indicators ⟡

- Stakeholders express dissatisfaction with development progress or quality
- Stakeholder participation in project meetings decreases
- Stakeholders begin seeking alternative solutions or vendors
- Escalation of concerns to higher levels of management
- Reduced cooperation or responsiveness from business stakeholders

## Detection Methods ○

- **Stakeholder Satisfaction Surveys:** Regular assessment of stakeholder satisfaction with development team performance
- **Communication Frequency Analysis:** Monitor changes in stakeholder engagement and communication patterns
- **Escalation Tracking:** Track frequency and nature of issues escalated to management
- **Project Support Assessment:** Evaluate level of stakeholder support and cooperation with projects
- **Feedback Session Analysis:** Analyze themes and concerns raised in stakeholder feedback sessions


## Examples

A business stakeholder becomes increasingly frustrated when a customer portal project misses three consecutive delivery milestones, with each delay discovered only at the last minute. The development team provides little visibility into progress and doesn't communicate the technical challenges they're facing. The stakeholder loses confidence in the team's ability to deliver and begins exploring outsourcing options for future projects. Another example involves stakeholders who become frustrated when delivered features don't work as expected and require multiple rounds of fixes before becoming usable, leading them to question the development team's competence and request more oversight of future work.
