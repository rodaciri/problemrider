## Description
Style arguments in code reviews is a situation where a significant amount of time in code reviews is spent debating trivial style issues instead of focusing on logic and design. This is a common problem in teams that do not have a clear set of coding standards. Style arguments in code reviews can lead to a number of problems, including a decrease in productivity, an increase in frustration, and a general slowdown in the code review process.


## Indicators ⟡
- Code reviews are often contentious.
- There are a lot of comments about style in code reviews.
- Code reviews take a long time to complete.
- Developers are not happy with the code review process.


## Symptoms ▲

- [Poor Test Coverage](poor-test-coverage.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.626, Strength: 0.858">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The time wasted on trivial style debates during code reviews diverts focus from essential quality assurance practices, leading to critical areas of the codebase remaining untested and increasing vulnerability in legacy systems.
- [Review Process Breakdown](review-process-breakdown.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.448, Strength: 0.788">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The excessive focus on trivial style debates during code reviews diverts attention from identifying critical issues, leading to a breakdown in the review process that fails to enhance code quality and address more significant design concerns.
- [Team Members Not Engaged in Review Process](team-members-not-engaged-in-review-process.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.447, Strength: 0.865">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The excessive focus on trivial style debates during code reviews discourages broader engagement and meaningful feedback from team members, resulting in a repetitive assignment of the same reviewers and a lack of diverse perspectives, ultimately indicating a deeper issue with the review process.
- [Flaky Tests](flaky-tests.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.445, Strength: 0.811">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Excessive focus on trivial style debates during code reviews often leads to neglecting proper test design and implementation, resulting in unreliable tests that fail intermittently due to overlooked dependencies or improper setups.
- [Analysis Paralysis](analysis-paralysis.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.439, Strength: 0.875">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Excessive focus on trivial style issues during code reviews diverts attention from critical decision-making and problem-solving, leading teams to become mired in indecision and halting progress on necessary implementation tasks.
- [Reduced Feature Quality](reduced-feature-quality.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.396, Strength: 0.914">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Excessive debates over trivial style issues during code reviews divert attention and resources away from addressing critical logic and design elements, leading to insufficient time for refining features and ultimately resulting in lower-quality user experiences and functionality.
- [Monolithic Architecture Constraints](monolithic-architecture-constraints.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.374, Strength: 0.866">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Debates over trivial style issues in code reviews can indicate a lack of clear guidelines and standards, which, in the context of a large and complex codebase, contributes to monolithic architecture constraints, making it harder to maintain and evolve the system effectively.
- [Inefficient Code](inefficient-code.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.353, Strength: 0.848">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The excessive focus on trivial style debates during code reviews diverts attention from critical performance considerations, leading to inefficient code that may not be optimized for speed or resource usage, thus manifesting as a symptom of the review process's misalignment with core development priorities.
- [Inconsistent Naming Conventions](inconsistent-naming-conventions.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.335, Strength: 0.827">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Conflicting naming conventions lead to confusion among developers, prompting excessive debates during code reviews about style rather than allowing for a more productive focus on logic and design, thereby revealing the underlying issue of prioritizing trivial matters over meaningful improvements in the codebase.
- [Micromanagement Culture](micromanagement-culture.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.315, Strength: 0.743">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Excessive focus on trivial style issues in code reviews often stems from a management culture that stifles team autonomy, leading to a need for validation on minor decisions and resulting in inefficient use of review time.
- [Undefined Code Style Guidelines](undefined-code-style-guidelines.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.310, Strength: 0.717">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of clear, agreed-upon coding standards leads to subjective feedback during code reviews, causing time to be wasted on trivial style debates rather than addressing logical and design issues, which is a common challenge in maintaining legacy systems.
- [Delayed Bug Fixes](delayed-bug-fixes.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.307, Strength: 0.789">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Excessive debates over trivial style issues during code reviews divert attention and resources away from addressing critical bugs, resulting in prolonged unresolved issues and user dissatisfaction.
- [Team Coordination Issues](team-coordination-issues.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.300, Strength: 0.896">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Frequent debates over trivial style issues during code reviews indicate a lack of shared coding standards and practices among team members, which can lead to coordination challenges and hinder collaborative development in a legacy codebase.

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○
- **Analyze Code Review Comments:** Look for a high frequency of comments related to style and formatting.
- **Team Surveys:** Ask developers if they are happy with the code review process.
- **Retrospectives:** Use retrospectives to identify problems with the code review process.


## Examples
A developer submits a pull request for a new feature. The pull request is immediately met with a flurry of comments about style. One developer wants the developer to use tabs instead of spaces. Another developer wants the developer to use a different naming convention for variables. The developer spends the next few hours arguing with the other developers about style. The pull request is eventually merged, but not before a lot of time and energy has been wasted.
