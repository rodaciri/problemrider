## Description

System integration blindness occurs when teams lack visibility into how individual components behave when integrated as a complete system. While individual services, modules, or components may function correctly in isolation, their interactions, data flows, and dependencies create emergent behaviors that are difficult to predict or test. This blindness to system-level integration issues leads to failures that only manifest when components are combined, often during deployment or under real-world usage conditions.


## Indicators ⟡

- Integration issues consistently surface during deployment rather than during development
- Components that pass individual testing fail when deployed together
- Data inconsistencies appear across system boundaries
- Performance degrades significantly when systems are integrated
- Debugging requires extensive investigation across multiple components


## Symptoms ▲

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Root Causes ▼

- [Monitoring Gaps](monitoring-gaps.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.398, Strength: 0.903">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Insufficient production monitoring obscures real-time insights into component interactions, preventing the early detection of integration issues and contributing to failures that only emerge when disparate parts are combined.
- [Shared Dependencies](shared-dependencies.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.398, Strength: 0.944">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The reliance on a common set of libraries and frameworks can lead to conflicts and unforeseen interactions between components, resulting in a lack of visibility into how they will perform when integrated, ultimately causing failures that were not apparent during isolated testing.
- [Silent Data Corruption](silent-data-corruption.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.374, Strength: 0.894">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Silent data corruption creates undetected discrepancies in data as it flows between components, leading to unexpected failures during integration due to a lack of visibility into the integrity of the underlying data being shared.
- [Bottleneck Formation](bottleneck-formation.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.373, Strength: 0.911">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The presence of specific constraints within teams or processes leads to insufficient communication and coordination, resulting in a fragmented understanding of how individual components interact, which ultimately causes failures during system integration.
- [Shared Database](shared-database.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.371, Strength: 0.921">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The reliance on a single shared database can lead to discrepancies in data handling and assumptions between components, resulting in integration failures that expose a lack of comprehensive understanding of the system's end-to-end behavior.
- [Incomplete Projects](incomplete-projects.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.345, Strength: 0.848">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The failure to complete features due to shifting priorities leads to an underdeveloped understanding of how components interact, resulting in integration issues when these components are eventually brought together.
- [Poor Encapsulation](poor-encapsulation.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.333, Strength: 0.927">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of cohesive data and behavior management leads to tightly coupled components that fail to communicate effectively during integration, ultimately resulting in an incomplete understanding of system interactions and behaviors.
- [Cascade Failures](cascade-failures.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.332, Strength: 0.794">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The inability to anticipate how a single change affects interdependent components leads to a lack of comprehensive understanding of the system's behavior as a whole, causing seemingly isolated components to fail when integrated.
- [System Outages](system-outages.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.320, Strength: 0.856">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Frequent service interruptions and system failures hinder the comprehensive understanding of how components interact within the legacy system, leading to a lack of awareness about integration issues that only emerge when these components are combined.
- [Unclear Sharing Expectations](unclear-sharing-expectations.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.312, Strength: 0.925">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of clarity around necessary information sharing leads to incomplete integration requirements, which hinders the comprehensive understanding of system interactions, ultimately causing components to function correctly in isolation but fail to work together as intended.
- [Tangled Cross-Cutting Concerns](tangled-cross-cutting-concerns.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.312, Strength: 0.840">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The failure to properly manage cross-cutting concerns leads to tightly coupled components that obscure their interdependencies, resulting in a lack of comprehensive understanding during integration and ultimately causing functional discrepancies in the system.
- [User Confusion](user-confusion.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.312, Strength: 0.903">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  User confusion arises when end users observe inconsistent behavior across components, which obscures their understanding of the system's integration, ultimately leading to overlooked flaws during the integration process that would otherwise be evident through user interactions.
- [Misunderstanding of OOP](misunderstanding-of-oop.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.310, Strength: 0.897">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  A lack of understanding of object-oriented programming principles often results in tightly coupled components and unclear interfaces, leading to integration failures as individual parts do not effectively communicate or collaborate within the overall system architecture.
- [Hidden Side Effects](hidden-side-effects.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.309, Strength: 0.838">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Undocumented side effects in legacy components can alter the state or behavior of integrated systems in unexpected ways, leading to failures when these components are combined, as the original developers may not have accounted for these interactions in their isolated testing.
- [Poor User Experience (UX) Design](poor-user-experience-ux-design.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.308, Strength: 0.812">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  In legacy systems, a confusing user interface and unmet user needs hinder comprehensive understanding of component interactions, leading to integration failures as users cannot accurately communicate functional requirements or identify dependencies during development.
- [Breaking Changes](breaking-changes.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.301, Strength: 0.814">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  API updates introduce breaking changes that disrupt established client integrations, leading to a lack of awareness about how components interact in a complete system, ultimately exposing integration failures that were previously unnoticed.

## Detection Methods ○

- **End-to-End User Journey Testing:** Verify complete workflows across all system components
- **Integration Environment Monitoring:** Track how components behave when deployed together
- **Dependency Mapping:** Document and test all system interdependencies
- **Contract Testing Implementation:** Verify that API contracts work correctly in integrated scenarios
- **Production-Like Testing:** Use environments that mirror production complexity for integration testing
- **Cross-Component Tracing:** Implement distributed tracing to understand system-level behavior


## Examples

A microservices-based ordering system has individual services (inventory, payment, shipping) that all pass their unit and integration tests. However, when deployed together, race conditions occur during high-volume periods where inventory is decremented after payment processing begins, leading to customers being charged for out-of-stock items. The issue only manifests under realistic load with multiple concurrent transactions. Another example involves a healthcare platform where patient data synchronization works perfectly in testing environments with simple data, but fails in production when dealing with complex patient records that reference multiple external systems, causing data integrity issues that affect patient care coordination.
