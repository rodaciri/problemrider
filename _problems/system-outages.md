## Description

System outages occur when software systems become unavailable, unresponsive, or fail to function correctly, preventing users from accessing services or completing tasks. These interruptions can range from brief service disruptions to complete system failures lasting hours or days. Frequent outages indicate underlying problems with system design, infrastructure, operations, or code quality that compromise business continuity and user trust.


## Indicators ⟡

- Services become unavailable on a regular basis
- Users frequently report inability to access system functionality
- Error rates spike during peak usage periods
- System failures require manual intervention to restore service
- Recovery time from failures is consistently long

## Detection Methods ○

- **Availability Monitoring:** Track system uptime and availability percentages
- **Outage Frequency Analysis:** Monitor how often outages occur and their duration
- **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR):** Measure time required to restore service after failures
- **User Impact Assessment:** Evaluate business and user impact of service interruptions
- **Root Cause Analysis:** Systematic investigation of outage causes to identify patterns


## Examples

An e-commerce website experiences daily outages during peak shopping hours because the database server becomes overwhelmed by concurrent user sessions. Each outage lasts 30-60 minutes while the operations team restarts database services and clears connection pools. Customers abandon shopping carts during these interruptions, leading to significant revenue loss. The frequent outages damage customer trust and cause many users to shop with competitors instead. Investigation reveals that the database server was adequate when the site launched but was never upgraded as user traffic grew. Another example involves a SaaS application that fails every few weeks due to memory leaks in the application code. The system gradually consumes more memory until it crashes, requiring manual restart. Users lose unsaved work during these failures, and the unpredictable nature of the outages makes it difficult for customers to plan their work around the system's availability.
