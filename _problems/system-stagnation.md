## Description

System stagnation occurs when software systems fail to evolve and improve over time, remaining largely unchanged despite changing business requirements, technological advances, and user needs. This stagnation can result from technical barriers, organizational constraints, or cultural resistance to change. Stagnant systems gradually become less effective, more expensive to maintain, and increasingly misaligned with business objectives.


## Indicators ⟡

- Core system functionality hasn't been significantly updated in years
- Technology stack remains unchanged despite better alternatives becoming available
- Business processes are constrained by inflexible system capabilities
- User interfaces and experiences remain outdated compared to modern standards
- Integration capabilities lag behind current industry practices

## Examples

A healthcare management system built in 2005 still uses the same user interface, database schema, and integration patterns despite significant advances in healthcare technology, user experience design, and data interoperability standards. Medical staff struggle with cumbersome workflows that haven't been updated to reflect modern clinical practices, and the system cannot easily integrate with new medical devices or electronic health record systems. The hospital's ability to adopt new healthcare technologies is severely limited by their stagnant core system, putting them at a competitive disadvantage. Another example involves a manufacturing company whose inventory management system was built 12 years ago and hasn't been significantly updated since. The system lacks modern features like real-time tracking, mobile access, and automated reordering that competitors use to optimize their operations. The company's supply chain efficiency suffers because their system cannot support modern logistics practices and integration with supplier systems.
