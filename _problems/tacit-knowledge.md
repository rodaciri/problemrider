## Description
Tacit knowledge is knowledge that is difficult to transfer to another person by means of writing it down or verbalizing it. It is often learned through experience, and it is often difficult to articulate. Tacit knowledge can be a major problem in software development, as it can lead to knowledge silos and a slowdown in knowledge transfer.


## Indicators ⟡
- There is a lot of knowledge that is not written down.
- New team members have a difficult time getting up to speed.
- The team is heavily reliant on a few senior developers.
- There is a lot of duplicated effort as new team members have to rediscover the same information.


## Symptoms ▲

- [Legacy Skill Shortage](legacy-skill-shortage.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.657, Strength: 0.906">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The difficulty in transferring critical knowledge about aging technologies leads to a reliance on a shrinking pool of experienced developers, resulting in maintenance bottlenecks and heightened risk of system failure.
- [Complex Domain Model](complex-domain-model.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.598, Strength: 0.830">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The difficulty in articulating and transferring intricate, experiential insights leads to a convoluted representation of the business domain in software, resulting in a complex system that is challenging to comprehend and implement effectively.
- [Reduced Team Productivity](reduced-team-productivity.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.523, Strength: 0.959">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The difficulty in transferring critical, experiential knowledge among team members leads to misunderstandings and inefficiencies, ultimately resulting in decreased overall productivity and effectiveness in the development process of legacy systems.
- [Monolithic Architecture Constraints](monolithic-architecture-constraints.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.486, Strength: 0.870">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  As tacit knowledge remains undocumented and confined within individuals, it leads to a lack of clear architectural understanding, causing the codebase to become overly complex and monolithic, which in turn hampers maintainability and scalability.
- [Analysis Paralysis](analysis-paralysis.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.466, Strength: 0.896">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  When teams struggle to articulate and document complex, untransferable knowledge, it leads to excessive deliberation and analysis, causing them to become immobilized in research without progressing to implementation in legacy systems.
- [Technical Architecture Limitations](technical-architecture-limitations.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.462, Strength: 0.914">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The inability to effectively document and share specialized knowledge within a team leads to architectural decisions that are based on incomplete understanding, resulting in a system design that is rigid and unable to adapt to evolving requirements, thus manifesting as performance and scalability issues.
- [Inability to Innovate](inability-to-innovate.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.426, Strength: 0.910">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The accumulation of unshared, undocumented expertise within the team leads to a reliance on existing processes, resulting in a lack of time and resources for exploring innovative solutions, thus stifling future advancements.
- [Micromanagement Culture](micromanagement-culture.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.407, Strength: 0.740">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  A culture that demands approval for routine decisions often emerges when critical knowledge is not documented or easily communicated, leading to a reliance on centralized authority and micromanagement as a workaround for the lack of shared understanding within legacy systems.
- [Unclear Documentation Ownership](unclear-documentation-ownership.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.396, Strength: 0.853">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The lack of clear responsibility for maintaining documentation often stems from individuals relying on their tacit knowledge, resulting in outdated or inconsistent information that fails to capture crucial insights needed for effective system maintenance and evolution.
- [Team Coordination Issues](team-coordination-issues.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.392, Strength: 0.954">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The difficulties in team coordination arise from the unshared, experiential insights of individual developers, which leads to misunderstandings and inefficiencies in collaborative work on the legacy codebase.
- [Monolithic Functions and Classes](monolithic-functions-and-classes.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.389, Strength: 0.811">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The presence of overly complex and multifunctional components indicates a reliance on unarticulated expertise, as developers struggle to decompose responsibilities into manageable parts without clear documentation or shared understanding.
- [Inconsistent Onboarding Experience](inconsistent-onboarding-experience.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.358, Strength: 0.829">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The variation in onboarding experiences reflects the difficulty in transferring critical, nuanced knowledge that is often held by experienced team members, leading to inconsistent training and support for new hires in legacy systems.
- [Inadequate Test Data Management](inadequate-test-data-management.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.356, Strength: 0.857">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The reliance on undocumented processes and implicit expertise hinders the creation of realistic and comprehensive test data, resulting in inadequate test scenarios that fail to simulate actual usage conditions in legacy systems.
- [Test Debt](test-debt.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.327, Strength: 0.924">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  In legacy systems, the difficulty in transferring critical knowledge often results in insufficient documentation and inadequate testing practices, leading to accumulated risks and reduced product robustness, which manifest as test debt.
- [Procrastination on Complex Tasks](procrastination-on-complex-tasks.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.320, Strength: 0.805">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Procrastination on complex tasks often arises when individuals struggle to articulate or transfer their implicit knowledge, leading them to avoid challenging work that requires deep understanding and cognitive effort, particularly within legacy systems where outdated processes and undocumented practices compound the difficulty.
- [Knowledge Silos](knowledge-silos.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.319, Strength: 0.798">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The presence of untransferrable knowledge within legacy systems fosters isolated pockets of expertise among team members, leading to a lack of shared understanding and collaboration, which manifests as knowledge silos that hinder overall team performance and innovation.
- [Slow Feature Development](slow-feature-development.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.307, Strength: 0.968">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The slow pace of feature development is often a direct result of the difficulty in transferring critical, unrecorded insights about the legacy codebase, which leads to misunderstandings and inefficiencies among team members, ultimately hindering progress.
- [Difficult Developer Onboarding](difficult-developer-onboarding.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.305, Strength: 0.808">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The prolonged time for new team members to become productive is indicative of the challenges posed by knowledge that cannot be easily documented or communicated, leading to confusion and inefficiencies in navigating complex legacy systems.

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○
- **Developer Surveys:** Ask developers if they feel like they have the knowledge they need to do their jobs.
- **Code Reviews:** Look for code that is difficult to understand.
- **Pair Programming:** Use pair programming to help new team members learn the tacit knowledge of the team.


## Examples
A company has a legacy system that was written by a single developer who has since left the company. The developer did not write any documentation, so all the knowledge about the system is tacit knowledge. The new developers who are responsible for maintaining the system have a very difficult time getting up to speed. They are constantly making mistakes, and the number of bugs is increasing. This is a common problem in companies that do not have a culture of knowledge sharing.
