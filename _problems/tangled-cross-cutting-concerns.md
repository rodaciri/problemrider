## Description
Tangled cross-cutting concerns is a situation where cross-cutting concerns, such as logging, security, and transactions, are tightly coupled with the business logic. This is a common problem in monolithic architectures, where there is no clear separation of concerns. Tangled cross-cutting concerns can lead to a number of problems, including code duplication, tight coupling issues, and difficult-to-test code.

## Indicators ⟡
- The same code for logging, security, or transactions is repeated in multiple places.
- It is not possible to change the implementation of a cross-cutting concern without affecting the business logic.
- It is not possible to test the business logic without also testing the cross-cutting concerns.
- The code is difficult to understand and maintain.

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○
- **Code Reviews:** Look for code where cross-cutting concerns are mixed in with the business logic.
- **Static Analysis Tools:** Use tools to identify duplicated code and other code smells.
- **Architectural Diagrams:** Create a diagram of the system architecture to identify where the cross-cutting concerns are located.

## Examples
A company has a large, monolithic e-commerce application. The application has a number of different services, including a product catalog, a shopping cart, and a payment gateway. The code for logging, security, and transactions is duplicated in all of the services. This makes it difficult to change the implementation of a cross-cutting concern, and it also makes it difficult to test the business logic in isolation. As a result, the code is difficult to maintain, and the code quality is poor.
