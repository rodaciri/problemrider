## Description

Team confusion occurs when team members lack clear understanding of what they should be working on, how they should approach their work, or how their work fits into broader project goals. This confusion leads to misaligned efforts, duplicated work, and wasted resources as team members work based on different assumptions or interpretations of requirements and priorities.

## Indicators ⟡

- Team members frequently ask for clarification about basic project goals or priorities
- Different team members have conflicting understanding of the same requirements
- Work output doesn't align with stakeholder expectations despite team effort
- Team meetings spend excessive time on clarification rather than decision-making
- Multiple team members work on the same problems without coordination

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Duplicated Work](duplicated-work.md):** Multiple team members unknowingly work on the same tasks
- **[Misaligned Deliverables](misaligned-deliverables.md):** Work output doesn't match stakeholder expectations
- **[Wasted Development Effort](wasted-development-effort.md):** Effort is spent on work that doesn't contribute to project goals
- **[Delayed Decision Making](delayed-decision-making.md):** Confusion leads to hesitation and delayed decision-making
- **[Team Coordination Issues](team-coordination-issues.md):** Poor coordination due to unclear understanding of roles and responsibilities

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Unclear Goals and Priorities](unclear-goals-and-priorities.md):** Project objectives haven't been clearly defined or communicated
- **[Communication Breakdown](communication-breakdown.md):** Information isn't effectively shared across the team
- **[Changing Project Scope](changing-project-scope.md):** Frequent changes create uncertainty about current direction
- **[Information Decay](information-decay.md):** Important information isn't documented or easily accessible
- **Role Ambiguity:** Team member responsibilities aren't clearly defined

## Detection Methods ○

- **Understanding Assessment:** Survey team members about their understanding of project goals and priorities
- **Alignment Testing:** Compare team member interpretations of the same requirements or goals
- **Clarification Request Tracking:** Monitor frequency of requests for clarification or direction
- **Work Output Analysis:** Assess whether completed work aligns with intended outcomes
- **Meeting Content Analysis:** Evaluate how much meeting time is spent on clarification versus progress

## Examples

A development team receives a requirement to "improve system performance" but each team member interprets this differently - one focuses on database optimization, another on frontend response times, and a third on server capacity. After two weeks of work, they discover they've been optimizing different things and their efforts don't address the actual performance issue that stakeholders were concerned about. Another example involves a team where half the members think they're building a customer-facing feature while the other half believe it's an internal administrative tool, leading to conflicting design decisions and incompatible implementation approaches.
