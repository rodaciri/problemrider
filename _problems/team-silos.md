## Description
Team silos are a common organizational problem where different teams or individuals work in isolation from each other. This can lead to a number of problems, including duplicated effort, inconsistent solutions, and a lack of knowledge sharing. In a software development context, team silos can be particularly damaging. When developers don't communicate with each other, they are likely to solve the same problems in different ways, which can lead to a fragmented and inconsistent codebase. This can make the system more difficult to maintain and evolve over time. This problem leads to knowledge silos, single points of failure, and reduced team resilience. When severe, it can result in a "bus factor" of one, where the loss of a single team member would be catastrophic to the project.


## Indicators ⟡
- Different teams are working on similar features without any coordination.
- There is a lack of awareness of what other teams are working on.
- Knowledge is concentrated in a few key individuals, and it is not being shared with the rest of the team.
- There is a sense of "us versus them" between different teams.
- The team does not have a culture of knowledge sharing.
- The team is not using any tools to facilitate knowledge sharing.

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○
- **Organizational Network Analysis:** Analyze the communication patterns within the organization to identify teams that are isolated from each other.
- **Codebase Analysis:** Look for signs of team silos in the codebase, such as inconsistent coding styles, duplicated functionality, and a lack of reusable components.
- **Developer Surveys:** Ask developers about their experience with collaboration and knowledge sharing. Their feedback can be a valuable source of information.
- **Cross-Team Retrospectives:** Hold retrospectives that bring together members of different teams to discuss their experiences and identify opportunities for improvement.
- **Bus Factor Analysis:** Identify critical components or systems understood by only one or two people. Assess how many critical individuals, if removed, would severely impact the project.
- **Onboarding Time Metrics:** Track how long it takes for new hires to become fully productive.
- **Code Review Observations:** Notice if reviewers frequently explain fundamental concepts or patterns that should be common knowledge.
- **Post-Mortems/Retrospectives:** Analyze if recurring issues could have been prevented by better knowledge sharing.


## Examples
A large enterprise has two different teams working on its e-commerce website. One team is responsible for the front-end, and the other team is responsible for the back-end. The two teams are located in different buildings, and they rarely communicate with each other. As a result, the front-end and back-end of the website are poorly integrated, and there are a number of inconsistencies in the user experience. The company is also paying for two different teams to solve the same problems, which is a waste of resources.

A critical legacy system is maintained by a single senior engineer. When this engineer goes on vacation, a major bug emerges, and no one else on the team has enough knowledge to quickly diagnose and fix it, leading to prolonged downtime. In another case, two different teams within the same organization independently develop similar microservices, each solving common problems like authentication and logging from scratch, unaware of the other's work or existing internal libraries.
