## Description

Technical architecture limitations occur when the fundamental design and structure of a software system creates constraints that impede performance, scalability, maintainability, or development velocity. These limitations often arise from architectural decisions made early in development that become problematic as the system grows or requirements change. Unlike bugs or implementation issues, architectural limitations require fundamental design changes to resolve.


## Indicators ⟡

- System performance doesn't improve despite hardware upgrades
- Adding new features requires disproportionate effort due to architectural constraints
- System cannot scale to meet growing demands despite adequate resources
- Development velocity decreases as the system grows in complexity
- Workarounds are needed to implement functionality that should be straightforward

## Detection Methods ○

- **Performance Profiling:** Identify whether performance issues stem from architectural limitations
- **Scalability Testing:** Test whether architecture can handle expected growth
- **Development Velocity Tracking:** Monitor whether feature development becomes slower over time
- **Architectural Complexity Analysis:** Assess whether system complexity is justified by functionality
- **Technology Fitness Assessment:** Evaluate whether current architecture matches system requirements


## Examples

A web application was designed with a single monolithic database that handles all data storage. As the application grows, database queries become slower and the single database becomes a bottleneck for all operations. The architecture makes it impossible to scale different parts of the system independently, and every new feature must work within the constraints of the single database design. Attempts to optimize performance are limited because the fundamental architecture doesn't support horizontal scaling or data partitioning. Another example involves a messaging system designed with synchronous communication patterns that works well for small volumes but creates cascading failures and timeout issues when message volume increases. The synchronous architecture makes it impossible to handle load spikes gracefully, and the entire system becomes unreliable under normal production conditions.
