## Description

Technology isolation occurs when a system's technology stack becomes so outdated or specialized that it exists in isolation from current industry practices and modern development ecosystems. This isolation makes it difficult to find developers with relevant skills, integrate with current tools and services, or benefit from modern development practices and community innovations. The system becomes a "technology island" that requires specialized knowledge and custom solutions for problems that have standard solutions in modern environments.

## Indicators ⟡

- Difficulty recruiting developers with experience in the technology stack
- Limited availability of modern tools, libraries, or frameworks for the platform
- System cannot easily integrate with current industry-standard services
- Development practices differ significantly from current industry norms
- Technology vendors provide limited or discontinued support

- **Developer Satisfaction Surveys:** Assess team satisfaction with current technology choices
- **Community Activity Assessment:** Evaluate activity level and support for current technologies
- **Integration Capability Review:** Test ability to integrate with modern services and tools

## Examples

A financial services company maintains a critical trading system built on a proprietary 4GL language from the 1990s. Finding developers with experience in this language is extremely difficult, and new hires require months of training to become productive. The system cannot easily integrate with modern risk management tools, cloud services, or real-time analytics platforms, forcing the company to build custom solutions for capabilities that are standard in modern financial technology stacks. Another example involves a manufacturing company using a legacy SCADA system with proprietary protocols that cannot integrate with modern IoT devices, cloud analytics platforms, or mobile applications. The isolation from modern industrial technology ecosystems prevents the company from implementing predictive maintenance, real-time monitoring, or data-driven optimization that competitors using standard industrial IoT platforms can easily adopt.
