## Description
Technology lock-in is a situation where it is difficult or impossible to switch to a new technology because of the high cost or effort involved. This is a common problem in monolithic architectures, where the entire system is built on a single technology stack. Technology lock-in can make it difficult to innovate, and it can also lead to high costs if the technology becomes obsolete or the vendor goes out of business.


## Indicators ⟡
- The entire system is built on a single technology stack.
- It is difficult or impossible to use new technologies in the system.
- The development team is not able to keep up with the latest technology trends.
- The system is expensive to maintain because of the high cost of the technology.

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○
- **Technology Stack Analysis:** Analyze the technology stack of the system to identify which technologies are being used.
- **Developer Surveys:** Ask developers if they feel like they are able to use new technologies to improve the system.
- **Cost Analysis:** Analyze the cost of the technology to identify which technologies are the most expensive.


## Examples
A company has a large, monolithic e-commerce application that is built on a proprietary technology stack. The company is not able to use new technologies, such as cloud computing and microservices, because the system is not designed for them. As a result, the company is not able to innovate as quickly as its competitors. The company is also paying a lot of money for the proprietary technology, and they are locked into a single vendor.
