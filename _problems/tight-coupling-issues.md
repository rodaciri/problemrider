## Description

Tight coupling issues occur when system components are overly dependent on each other's internal implementations, making it difficult to modify, test, or replace individual components without affecting others. Tightly coupled systems are fragile, difficult to maintain, and resist change because modifications in one area often require changes throughout the system.

## Indicators ⟡

- Changes to one component frequently require changes to many other components
- Components cannot be tested in isolation without complex setup
- Circular dependencies between modules or classes
- Components accessing each other's internal data structures directly
- Difficulty replacing or upgrading individual components

## Symptoms ▲
- [Legacy Skill Shortage](legacy-skill-shortage.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.455, Strength: 0.703">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The excessive interdependence of components in legacy systems complicates updates and maintenance, leading to a reliance on a shrinking pool of skilled developers, who become bottlenecks, thereby highlighting the challenges of managing such tightly coupled architectures.
- [Poor Test Coverage](poor-test-coverage.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.447, Strength: 0.678">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The excessive interdependence of components leads to a lack of modularity, making it challenging to isolate and test individual parts of the codebase, which results in critical areas remaining untested and creating blind spots in quality assurance.
- [Technical Architecture Limitations](technical-architecture-limitations.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.444, Strength: 0.672">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Excessive interdependencies among components create rigid architectural constraints that hinder performance and scalability, thereby serving as a clear indicator of underlying coupling issues within legacy systems.
- [Flaky Tests](flaky-tests.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.412, Strength: 0.701">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Overly dependent components lead to inconsistent test scenarios where changes in one part of the system can unpredictably affect others, causing tests to fail intermittently and eroding confidence in the reliability of the test suite.
- [Regulatory Compliance Drift](regulatory-compliance-drift.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.393, Strength: 0.632">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Overly dependent components hinder the ability to adapt to evolving regulatory requirements, resulting in compliance gaps that reflect the rigidity and inflexibility inherent in the system's architecture.
- [Frequent Changes to Requirements](frequent-changes-to-requirements.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.379, Strength: 0.595">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The reliance of components on one another means that any change in requirements necessitates adjustments across multiple interconnected parts, causing cascading rework and delays that highlight the inflexibility and maintainability issues inherent in the system.
- [Complex Domain Model](complex-domain-model.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.372, Strength: 0.607">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Overly dependent components lead to a convoluted representation of the business domain, as changes in one part of the system necessitate extensive alterations in others, obscuring the overall complexity and hindering accurate implementation.
- [Reduced Team Productivity](reduced-team-productivity.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.362, Strength: 0.645">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The excessive interdependence of components leads to increased complexity and time spent on coordination during changes, which in turn hampers the development team's efficiency and output.
- [Unreleased Resources](unreleased-resources.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.355, Strength: 0.623">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Excessive interdependencies among components often lead to inadequate resource management, causing allocated resources to remain unreleased as changes to one part of the system inadvertently impact others, making it challenging to implement proper deallocation routines.
- [Analysis Paralysis](analysis-paralysis.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.313, Strength: 0.708">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Overly dependent components create uncertainty and fear of unintended consequences when making changes, leading teams to overanalyze rather than implement solutions, thereby stalling progress in development.

## Root Causes ▼
- [Shared Dependencies](shared-dependencies.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.357, Strength: 0.970">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The reliance on a common set of libraries and frameworks among multiple components creates interdependencies that hinder individual component modifications, leading to inflexible and tightly coupled system architecture.
- [Procedural Background](procedural-background.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.312, Strength: 0.958">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Developers accustomed to procedural programming often create tightly coupled code by failing to utilize encapsulation and abstraction principles, resulting in interdependent components that hinder system flexibility and maintainability.
- [Shared Database](shared-database.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.311, Strength: 0.959">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The reliance on a single database for multiple components creates tight coupling, as changes to the database schema or data structure necessitate simultaneous updates across all dependent services, thereby hindering flexibility and maintainability in legacy systems.

## Detection Methods ○

- **Dependency Analysis:** Analyze component dependencies and identify tight coupling patterns
- **Change Impact Analysis:** Track how changes in one component affect others
- **Cyclic Dependency Detection:** Identify circular dependencies between components
- **Interface vs Implementation Analysis:** Review how components interact with each other
- **Component Isolation Testing:** Test ability to run and test components independently

## Examples

An e-commerce order processing system has tight coupling between the inventory, payment, and shipping components. The inventory component directly accesses the payment database to check payment status, the payment component modifies inventory quantities directly, and the shipping component reads order data directly from payment tables. When the payment system needs to be upgraded to support new payment methods, it requires changes to all three components because they're all tightly coupled to the specific payment database schema and internal payment processing logic. Another example involves a user interface where UI components directly call business logic methods and access database entities. When the business logic needs to change, it breaks multiple UI components, and when the database schema changes, both business logic and UI components need updates, making any change expensive and risky.
