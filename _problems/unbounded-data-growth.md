## Description

Unbounded data growth occurs when data structures, caches, logs, or databases continuously accumulate data without any mechanism for cleanup, archiving, or size management. Unlike memory leaks which involve programming errors, this problem often stems from design oversight where systems are built to accumulate data but lack strategies for managing that data over time. As data grows without bounds, it leads to performance degradation, storage exhaustion, and eventual system failure.

## Indicators ⟡
- Database or file system usage continuously increases without corresponding business growth
- Application memory usage grows steadily over time during normal operation
- Query performance degrades as system runs longer
- Backup or maintenance operations take increasingly longer to complete
- System eventually crashes with out-of-disk-space or out-of-memory errors

## Symptoms ▲
- [Upstream Timeouts](upstream-timeouts.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.475, Strength: 0.661">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The continuous accumulation of data without effective management leads to increased processing times and resource contention, resulting in services timing out when trying to consume the API due to overwhelmed or inefficient data retrieval mechanisms.
- [Technical Architecture Limitations](technical-architecture-limitations.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.355, Strength: 0.666">ⓘ</span>

## Detection Methods ○
- **Storage Monitoring:** Track disk usage, database growth, and memory consumption over time
- **Performance Trend Analysis:** Monitor query response times and application performance metrics
- **Data Volume Analysis:** Measure the rate of data growth compared to business metrics
- **Cleanup Process Audits:** Verify that data cleanup and archiving processes are working effectively
- **Cache Hit Ratio Monitoring:** Track cache effectiveness as it grows in size

## Examples

A customer support system logs every user interaction, including page views, clicks, and system actions, storing them in a database table for analytics. Over two years, this table grows to contain 500 million records and consumes 2TB of storage. Queries to generate monthly reports that once took seconds now take 30 minutes because the system must scan through millions of irrelevant historical records. The database backup process fails because it cannot complete within the maintenance window. There's no business need to keep detailed interaction logs older than 90 days, but no one implemented an archiving strategy. Another example involves an application cache that stores user session data and computed results to improve performance. The cache is designed to improve response times but has no eviction policy. Over months of operation, it grows to consume 32GB of memory, causing the application server to spend most of its time in garbage collection rather than serving requests. What was intended to improve performance becomes the primary cause of performance problems.
