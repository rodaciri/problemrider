## Description
Unclear sharing expectations is a situation where it is not clear what information should be shared with the rest of the team. This is a common problem in teams that do not have a culture of knowledge sharing. Unclear sharing expectations can lead to a number of problems, including knowledge silos, poor communication, and team coordination issues.

## Indicators ⟡
- Team members are not sure what information they should share with the rest of the team.
- There is a lot of information that is not shared with the rest of the team.
- Team members are often surprised by information that they should have known about.
- There is a lot of duplicated effort as team members have to rediscover the same information.

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○
- **Developer Surveys:** Ask developers if they feel like they have the information they need to do their jobs.
- **Communication Audits:** Audit the communication channels to see what information is being shared.
- **Retrospectives:** Use retrospectives to identify what information is not being shared.

## Examples
A team is working on a new project. The team does not have a culture of knowledge sharing. There are no clear expectations about what information should be shared. As a result, the team members are not sure what information they should share with the rest of the team. This leads to a number of problems, including knowledge silos, poor communication, and team coordination issues.
