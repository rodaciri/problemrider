## Description
Uncontrolled codebase growth is a situation where a codebase grows in size and complexity without any control or planning. This is a common problem in long-lived projects, where new features are constantly being added without any thought to the overall design of the system. Uncontrolled codebase growth can lead to a number of problems, including high technical debt, bloated classes, and a general slowdown in development velocity.


## Indicators ⟡
- The codebase is becoming increasingly large and complex.
- It is taking longer and longer to add new features.
- The number of bugs is increasing.
- Developers are becoming more and more frustrated with the codebase.

## Examples
A company has a large, monolithic e-commerce application that has been in development for over 10 years. The codebase has grown to over a million lines of code, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain and extend. The development team is spending more and more time fixing bugs and less and less time adding new features. The company is starting to lose market share to its competitors, who are able to innovate more quickly.
