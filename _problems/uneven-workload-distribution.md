## Description

Uneven workload distribution occurs when work assignments are not balanced across team members, resulting in some individuals being consistently overloaded while others have lighter workloads. This imbalance can arise from various factors including knowledge silos, skill specialization, poor planning, or management decisions. The problem leads to burnout for overloaded members, underutilization of available resources, and reduced overall team effectiveness.

## Indicators ⟡

- Some team members consistently work overtime while others have spare capacity
- Certain individuals are assigned to most critical or complex tasks
- Work assignments are heavily skewed based on perceived expertise or availability
- Team members have vastly different numbers of assigned tasks or story points
- Some developers are constantly busy while others wait for work assignments

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○

- **Workload Metrics Tracking:** Monitor work assignments, hours worked, and task completion rates across team members
- **Capacity Utilization Analysis:** Compare planned versus actual work distribution across the team
- **Team Member Surveys:** Collect feedback about perceived workload fairness and balance
- **Overtime Patterns:** Track which team members consistently work beyond normal hours
- **Task Assignment Analysis:** Examine patterns in how tasks are assigned and distributed

## Examples

A development team has one senior developer who understands the legacy payment processing system, so all payment-related tasks are assigned to her. Over time, she becomes responsible for 60% of the critical features while other team members work on less complex tasks. She consistently works 50-60 hour weeks while her colleagues work standard 40-hour weeks, leading to burnout and resentment. The team's overall productivity is limited by her capacity, and project timelines depend entirely on her availability. Another example involves a team where the most experienced developer always volunteers for challenging tasks and rarely says no to additional work, while junior developers are given only simple bug fixes and maintenance tasks. This pattern prevents junior developers from growing their skills while overloading the senior developer, creating an unsustainable dynamic that limits both individual development and team scalability.
