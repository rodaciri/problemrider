## Description

Unmotivated employees exhibit low engagement, minimal initiative, and reduced commitment to project success.

Unmotivated team members not only underperform individually but can also negatively impact team dynamics and overall project momentum.


## Indicators ⟡

- Consistent minimal effort that meets only basic requirements
- Reluctance to take on additional responsibilities or challenges
- Lack of participation in team discussions and planning sessions
- Frequent absences or late arrivals without valid reasons
- Resistance to learning new skills or adopting new processes

## Detection Methods ○

- **Performance Review Analysis:** Track declining performance metrics over time
- **Engagement Surveys:** Regular anonymous surveys about job satisfaction and motivation

- **Initiative Tracking:** Monitor voluntary contributions and proactive behaviors


## Examples

A senior developer who was once enthusiastic about the project begins showing up late, completing only assigned tasks without any extra effort, and stops contributing ideas during team meetings. Investigation reveals they feel stuck in their role with no clear path to advancement and are frustrated that their suggestions for technical improvements are consistently ignored by management. Their disengagement begins affecting the junior developers who look up to them for guidance. Another example involves a QA engineer who becomes increasingly unmotivated after being assigned only repetitive manual testing tasks for months. They stop providing detailed bug reports, reduce their testing thoroughness, and begin looking for other opportunities. The quality of releases suffers as bugs slip through testing, and the team loses confidence in the QA process.
