## Description

Unpredictable system behavior occurs when modifications to one component cause unexpected changes or failures in other, seemingly unrelated parts of the system. This phenomenon is a hallmark of systems with poor separation of concerns, hidden dependencies, and implicit coupling. It makes software development extremely challenging because developers cannot reason about the impact of their changes, leading to defensive programming practices and reluctance to make necessary improvements.


## Indicators ⟡
- Developers frequently discover that their changes have affected unrelated functionality
- Bug reports mention symptoms that seem disconnected from recent changes
- Testing reveals failures in modules that weren't directly modified
- The team spends significant time investigating why changes broke seemingly unrelated features
- Code reviews focus heavily on trying to predict all possible side effects


## Symptoms ▲

## Detection Methods ○
- **Impact Analysis Tools:** Use dependency analysis tools to map actual vs. expected component relationships
- **Regression Testing Patterns:** Monitor which tests fail when specific modules are changed to identify hidden connections
- **Side Effect Monitoring:** Track system state changes during operations to identify unexpected mutations
- **Code Coupling Metrics:** Measure coupling between modules to identify areas with high interconnectedness
- **Change Impact Tracking:** Maintain logs of which areas are affected by changes to identify patterns of unexpected impact


## Examples

A developer modifies a user authentication function to improve password validation. The change seems isolated and passes all authentication-related tests. However, after deployment, the reporting system begins generating incorrect data because it was implicitly relying on a specific timing of authentication events to synchronize its data collection. The reporting system never directly interacted with authentication, but it depended on side effects of the authentication process that were never documented or made explicit. This hidden dependency caused data corruption that took days to diagnose because the connection between authentication and reporting was not obvious. Another example involves updating a product catalog service where changing the product description format inadvertently breaks the recommendation engine, which was parsing description text to extract features for its machine learning model.
