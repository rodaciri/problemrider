## Description
Unused indexes are database indexes that are not being utilized by any queries. While indexes are crucial for speeding up data retrieval, unused ones still consume disk space and, more importantly, add overhead to write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) because the database must update the index every time the underlying data changes. Regularly identifying and removing unused indexes is a key part of database maintenance and performance tuning, as it reclaims storage and reduces unnecessary processing.

## Indicators ⟡
- The database is using a lot of disk space, even though the data set is small.
- Write operations are slow, even though the database is not under heavy load.
- Backups and restores are taking a long time.
- The database is using a lot of memory, even when it is not under heavy load.

## Symptoms ▲

- **Increased Disk Space Usage:** Indexes consume disk space, and unused ones waste valuable storage.
- **Slower Write Operations:** Every `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operation on an indexed table requires updating its indexes, adding overhead.
- **Increased Backup/Restore Times:** Larger database sizes due to unused indexes lead to longer backup and restore processes.
- **Higher Memory Consumption:** Indexes, especially frequently accessed ones, can consume memory in the database buffer pool, even if they are not actively used for queries.
- **[Poor Caching Strategy](poor-caching-strategy.md):** Unused indexes can push useful data out of the database's memory cache.

## Root Causes ▼

- **Obsolete Queries:** Indexes were created for queries that are no longer in use or have been refactored.
- **Redundant Indexes:** Multiple indexes exist on the same or overlapping columns, where only one is truly effective.
- **Incorrect Index Creation:** Indexes were created based on assumptions or without proper analysis of query patterns.
- **[Schema Evolution Paralysis](schema-evolution-paralysis.md):** As the application evolves, old indexes become irrelevant, but are not removed.
- **Lack of Monitoring:** No process or tools are in place to identify and remove unused indexes.

## Detection Methods ○

- **Database Monitoring Tools:** Most modern database systems provide statistics on index usage (e.g., `pg_stat_user_indexes` in PostgreSQL, `sys.dm_db_index_usage_stats` in SQL Server, `information_schema.statistics` in MySQL combined with query logs).
- **Query Execution Plan Analysis:** Regularly analyze `EXPLAIN` plans for common queries to ensure they are using the most efficient indexes.
- **Automated Index Advisors:** Some database management systems or third-party tools offer automated index recommendations and usage analysis.
- **Periodic Database Audits:** Schedule regular reviews of database schema and index usage.

## Examples
A legacy e-commerce application has an `orders` table with an index on `customer_id` that was created years ago for a specific reporting query. That report has since been deprecated, but the index remains, adding overhead to every new order placed without providing any query performance benefit. In another case, a developer creates an index on `(column_A, column_B)` but later creates another index on `(column_A)`. The database's query optimizer might prefer the smaller `(column_A)` index for queries only involving `column_A`, rendering the composite index partially unused for those queries. Unused indexes are a form of technical debt in database management. While they don't directly cause application errors, they silently degrade write performance, waste resources, and complicate database maintenance, especially in large-scale systems.
