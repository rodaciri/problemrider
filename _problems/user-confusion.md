## Description
User confusion is a common problem in software systems. It occurs when end users encounter different behavior for what should be identical operations. This can lead to a number of problems, including frustration, a loss of trust in the system, and a great deal of frustration for the development team. User confusion is often a sign of a poorly designed system with a high degree of inconsistent behavior.

## Indicators ⟡
- The support team is constantly getting questions from users about how to use the system.
- The users are not using the system in the way that it was intended to be used.
- The users are making a lot of mistakes when they are using the system.
- The users are not happy with the system.

## Symptoms ▲
- **[Negative User Feedback](negative-user-feedback.md):** Users are vocal about their frustration with the system.
- **[Increased Customer Support Load](increased-customer-support-load.md):** The support team has to spend a lot of time dealing with questions from confused users.
- **[Declining Business Metrics](declining-business-metrics.md):** Users are not adopting the system because they find it to be too confusing.
- **[User Trust Erosion](user-trust-erosion.md):** Users lose trust in the system when it is difficult to use.

## Root Causes ▼
- **[Inconsistent Behavior](inconsistent-behavior.md):** The system behaves differently in different parts of the application.
- **[Synchronization Problems](synchronization-problems.md):** Changes made to one copy of the code are not propagated to the other copies.
- **Poor User Interface (UI) Design:** The UI is not intuitive and easy to use.
- **Lack of User Onboarding:** There is no process for teaching users how to use the system.

## Detection Methods ○
- **Usability Testing:** Use usability testing to identify areas of the system that are confusing to users.
- **User Feedback:** Listen to user feedback to identify areas of the system that are causing confusion.
- **Support Ticket Analysis:** Analyze support tickets to identify common questions and problems.
- **A/B Testing:** Use A/B testing to compare different versions of the UI to see which one is less confusing to users.

## Examples
An e-commerce website has a very confusing checkout flow. The users are not sure what they are supposed to do, and they are making a lot of mistakes. As a result, the company is losing a lot of sales. The problem could be solved by redesigning the checkout flow to be more intuitive and easy to use.
