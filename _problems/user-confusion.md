## Description
User confusion is a common problem in software systems. It occurs when end users encounter different behavior for what should be identical operations. This can lead to a number of problems, including frustration, a loss of trust in the system, and a great deal of frustration for the development team. User confusion is often a sign of a poorly designed system with a high degree of inconsistent behavior.


## Indicators ⟡

- The users are not using the system in the way that it was intended to be used.
- The users are making a lot of mistakes when they are using the system.
- The users are not happy with the system.

## Examples
An e-commerce website has a very confusing checkout flow. The users are not sure what they are supposed to do, and they are making a lot of mistakes. As a result, the company is losing a lot of sales. The problem could be solved by redesigning the checkout flow to be more intuitive and easy to use.
