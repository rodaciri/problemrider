## Description
User trust erosion is the gradual loss of confidence that users have in a software system. This is a serious problem that can have a significant impact on the success of a product. When users don't trust a system, they are less likely to use it, and they are more likely to switch to a competitor. User trust is a fragile thing that is easy to lose and difficult to regain. It is often the result of a series of small failures, such as bugs, performance issues, and security vulnerabilities.

## Indicators ⟡
- A decline in user engagement and retention.
- An increase in negative reviews and social media mentions.
- A decrease in the number of new users.
- A decline in the company's brand reputation.

## Symptoms ▲
- **[Negative User Feedback](negative-user-feedback.md):** Users are vocal about their dissatisfaction with the system.
- **[Declining Business Metrics](declining-business-metrics.md):** The erosion of user trust can lead to a decline in key business metrics, such as revenue and market share.
- **[Increased Customer Support Load](increased-customer-support-load.md):** The support team is inundated with questions and complaints from frustrated users.
- **[Competitive Disadvantage](competitive-disadvantage.md):** The company is unable to compete with other companies that have more reliable and trustworthy products.

## Root Causes ▼
- **[Release Instability](release-instability.md):** Frequent, buggy releases are a major contributor to user trust erosion.
- **[High Defect Rate in Production](high-defect-rate-in-production.md):** A high number of bugs in production can make a system feel unreliable and untrustworthy.
- **[Poor User Experience (UX) Design](poor-user-experience-ux-design.md):** A poorly designed user experience can be a major source of frustration for users.
- **Security Vulnerabilities:** Security breaches can have a devastating impact on user trust.
- **[Communication Breakdown](communication-breakdown.md):** A lack of transparency and communication with users can exacerbate the problem of user trust erosion.

## Detection Methods ○
- **User Satisfaction Surveys:** Regularly survey users to gauge their satisfaction with the system.
- **Net Promoter Score (NPS):** Use the NPS to measure user loyalty.
- **Social Media Monitoring:** Monitor social media for mentions of your product.
- **Churn Rate:** Track the rate at which users are leaving your product.

## Examples
A social media company releases a new version of its mobile app. The new version is full of bugs, and it is constantly crashing. Users are frustrated, and they are starting to leave the platform. The company is slow to respond to the issues, and they are not transparent with their users about what is going on. As a result, the company's reputation is damaged, and they lose a significant number of users to their competitors.
