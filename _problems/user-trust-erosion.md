## Description
User trust erosion is the gradual loss of confidence that users have in a software system. This is a serious problem that can have a significant impact on the success of a product. When users don't trust a system, they are less likely to use it, and they are more likely to switch to a competitor. User trust is a fragile thing that is easy to lose and difficult to regain. It is often the result of a series of small failures, such as bugs, performance issues, and security vulnerabilities.


## Indicators ⟡
- A decline in user engagement and retention.
- An increase in negative reviews and social media mentions.
- A decrease in the number of new users.
- A decline in the company's brand reputation.


## Symptoms ▲

- [Developer Frustration and Burnout](developer-frustration-and-burnout.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.363, Strength: 0.601">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Persistent reliability issues and emergency fixes create a high-pressure environment for developers, leading to frustration and burnout, which in turn reflects the declining user trust and engagement in the system.
- [Unreleased Resources](unreleased-resources.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.327, Strength: 0.642">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Frequent unreleased resources indicate poor maintenance and code quality, which can lead to system instabilities and crashes, further undermining user confidence in the system's reliability.
- [Increased Customer Support Load](increased-customer-support-load.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.322, Strength: 0.609">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Frequent system issues lead to user frustration and confusion, prompting them to seek help from customer support, which serves as an indicator of declining user trust and engagement in the reliability of the legacy system.
- [Flaky Tests](flaky-tests.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.316, Strength: 0.633">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Random test failures in legacy systems highlight underlying instability and unreliability, leading users to question the overall system quality and diminishing their trust in its performance.

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○
- **User Satisfaction Surveys:** Regularly survey users to gauge their satisfaction with the system.
- **Net Promoter Score (NPS):** Use the NPS to measure user loyalty.
- **Social Media Monitoring:** Monitor social media for mentions of your product.
- **Churn Rate:** Track the rate at which users are leaving your product.


## Examples
A social media company releases a new version of its mobile app. The new version is full of bugs, and it is constantly crashing. Users are frustrated, and they are starting to leave the platform. The company is slow to respond to the issues, and they are not transparent with their users about what is going on. As a result, the company's reputation is damaged, and they lose a significant number of users to their competitors.
