## Description

Vendor dependency occurs when organizations become excessively reliant on external suppliers, technology vendors, or service providers for critical business functions. This creates significant risk when vendors change their terms, discontinue services, experience outages, or fail to meet performance expectations. High vendor dependency reduces organizational flexibility and can lead to disrupted operations when vendor relationships encounter problems.


## Indicators ⟡

- Critical business functions depend entirely on external vendors
- Switching vendors would require significant time and expense
- Vendor contracts heavily favor the supplier with limited flexibility
- Organization has little control over vendor roadmaps or priorities
- Vendor performance issues directly impact business operations


## Symptoms ▲

- [Technical Architecture Limitations](technical-architecture-limitations.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.503, Strength: 0.797">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Excessive reliance on external vendors often leads to a rigid technical architecture that is tailored to specific third-party solutions, resulting in limitations that hinder performance and adaptability as changes in vendor availability or terms occur.
- [Complex Domain Model](complex-domain-model.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.501, Strength: 0.711">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The reliance on external vendors for complex domain modeling often leads to intricate and poorly understood systems, as the lack of control over vendor solutions can result in mismatches between business requirements and the implemented software, highlighting the underlying risks of dependency.
- [Legacy Skill Shortage](legacy-skill-shortage.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.477, Strength: 0.738">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The reliance on external vendors for legacy systems often leads to a decline in in-house expertise, resulting in a shortage of developers skilled in outdated technologies, which in turn creates maintenance bottlenecks and heightens the risk of system failures when vendor support is compromised.
- [Increased Customer Support Load](increased-customer-support-load.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.449, Strength: 0.695">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  When external vendors fail to deliver reliable services or products, users encounter obstacles that hinder their ability to complete tasks, leading to an increase in support requests as they seek assistance to resolve these frustrations.
- [Micromanagement Culture](micromanagement-culture.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.429, Strength: 0.820">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The excessive reliance on external vendors leads to a lack of trust in the internal team's decision-making capabilities, resulting in a culture where management feels compelled to micromanage routine decisions to mitigate risks associated with vendor performance.
- [Project Authority Vacuum](project-authority-vacuum.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.415, Strength: 0.822">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The excessive reliance on external vendors undermines organizational confidence and authority, leading to insufficient executive support for critical projects, which in turn hampers resource allocation and prioritization in legacy systems.
- [Regulatory Compliance Drift](regulatory-compliance-drift.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.415, Strength: 0.685">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Excessive reliance on external vendors often leads to outdated systems that cannot adapt to changing regulatory requirements, resulting in compliance gaps that highlight the vulnerabilities of legacy software.
- [Inconsistent Onboarding Experience](inconsistent-onboarding-experience.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.312, Strength: 0.706">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  The reliance on external vendors for training materials and onboarding support leads to variability in the onboarding process, as the availability and quality of vendor resources fluctuate, resulting in inconsistent experiences for new team members.

## Detection Methods ○

- **Vendor Dependency Mapping:** Identify all critical business functions that depend on external vendors
- **Risk Assessment Matrix:** Evaluate impact of vendor failures on business operations
- **Contract Analysis:** Review vendor agreements for flexibility and exit provisions
- **Alternative Evaluation:** Assess availability and viability of alternative vendors or solutions
- **Business Continuity Testing:** Test organization's ability to function when vendors are unavailable


## Examples

A software company relies entirely on a third-party cloud service for their customer authentication system. When the vendor experiences a multi-day outage, all customer logins fail and the company cannot serve existing customers or acquire new ones. The company discovers they have no backup authentication system and migrating to an alternative would take months due to the proprietary APIs and data formats used by the current vendor. The outage costs significant revenue and damages customer relationships. Another example involves a manufacturing company that depends on a single ERP vendor for all business operations. When the vendor announces they're discontinuing the product version being used and forcing an expensive upgrade, the company faces a choice between paying substantial upgrade costs or undertaking a complex migration to a different system. The vendor dependency prevents the company from choosing the most cost-effective solution and forces them to accept unfavorable terms.
