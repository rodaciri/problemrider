## Description

Vendor lock-in occurs when a system becomes so tightly integrated with a specific vendor's technology, APIs, or services that switching to alternatives becomes prohibitively expensive, technically complex, or practically impossible. This dependency limits strategic flexibility, increases long-term costs, and creates significant business risk if the vendor changes pricing, discontinues services, or fails to meet evolving requirements. The problem is particularly acute in legacy modernization efforts where vendor-specific features may seem attractive in the short term but create long-term constraints.

## Indicators ⟡

- Architecture decisions that heavily favor proprietary APIs over open standards
- Increasing use of vendor-specific features that have no equivalent alternatives
- Data storage formats that are proprietary to a single vendor
- Integration patterns that are tightly coupled to vendor-specific implementations
- Development team knowledge becoming concentrated in vendor-specific technologies
- Licensing costs that represent a growing percentage of total system costs
- Difficulty evaluating alternative solutions due to migration complexity

## Detection Methods ○

- Conduct regular architecture reviews focused on vendor dependency analysis
- Monitor percentage of codebase that uses vendor-specific APIs or features
- Assess data portability and export capabilities for critical business information
- Evaluate licensing cost trends and pricing power of primary vendors
- Review contract terms for exclusivity clauses or switching penalties
- Analyze skills and knowledge distribution across vendor-specific technologies
- Test migration scenarios by implementing proof-of-concept alternatives
- Survey development team about perceived switching costs and technical barriers

## Examples

A financial services company builds its trading platform heavily integrated with a cloud provider's proprietary machine learning services, real-time messaging system, and specialized financial data APIs. Over three years, the platform becomes deeply dependent on these services, with business logic tightly coupled to vendor-specific data formats and processing capabilities. When the cloud provider announces a 300% price increase for these services and the company investigates alternatives, they discover that migration would require rewriting 60% of their core algorithms, rebuilding their data pipeline, and training their entire development team on new technologies. The estimated migration cost and timeline are so significant that the company has no choice but to accept the price increase, effectively eliminating their negotiating power and strategic flexibility for future technology decisions.
