## Description

Vendor relationship strain occurs when tensions, conflicts, or dissatisfaction develop between an organization and its external suppliers or service providers. This strain can result from unrealistic expectations, poor communication, contract disputes, quality issues, or misaligned incentives. Strained vendor relationships can jeopardize project success and create risks for ongoing operations.

## Indicators ⟡

- Frequent disagreements about deliverables, timelines, or quality standards
- Vendors become unresponsive or provide minimal service levels
- Contract disputes or requests for renegotiation become common
- Vendor threatens to terminate relationship or significantly raise prices
- Communication becomes formal and adversarial rather than collaborative

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○

- **Vendor Satisfaction Surveys:** Regular assessment of vendor satisfaction with the relationship
- **Relationship Health Monitoring:** Track indicators like response times, escalation frequency, and communication tone
- **Contract Performance Analysis:** Monitor whether both parties are meeting contractual obligations
- **Dispute Frequency Tracking:** Count and categorize conflicts or disagreements with vendors
- **Vendor Retention Analysis:** Track vendor turnover and reasons for relationship terminations

## Examples

A software development project experiences escalating tensions with an offshore development vendor due to unclear requirements, frequent scope changes, and unrealistic deadlines specified in the contract. The vendor becomes increasingly unresponsive to requests, provides minimal status updates, and delivers work that doesn't meet quality standards. Communication deteriorates to formal contract enforcement letters, and the vendor threatens to terminate the relationship unless significant additional payments are made. Another example involves a cloud hosting vendor relationship that sours when unexpected traffic spikes result in massive overage charges that weren't clearly communicated in the contract, leading to payment disputes and threats of service termination.
