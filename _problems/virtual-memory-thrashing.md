## Description

Virtual memory thrashing occurs when the system's working set of active pages exceeds available physical memory, causing the operating system to constantly swap pages between RAM and disk storage. This creates a destructive cycle where the system spends more time managing virtual memory than executing application code, leading to severe performance degradation and system unresponsiveness.


## Indicators ⟡

- Extremely high disk I/O activity with minimal actual data processing
- System responsiveness drops significantly under memory pressure
- Page fault rates increase dramatically during memory-intensive operations
- Available physical memory is consistently near zero
- Swap file usage grows rapidly and remains high


## Symptoms ▲

- [Poor Caching Strategy](poor-caching-strategy.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.456, Strength: 0.744">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Excessive paging activity leads to frequent data retrieval from the original source instead of utilizing cached data, resulting in increased latency and further exacerbating performance issues in systems with limited memory resources.
- [Unreleased Resources](unreleased-resources.md) <span class="info-tooltip" title="Confidence: 0.378, Strength: 0.671">ⓘ</span>
<br/>  Excessive allocation of unreleased resources increases memory pressure, leading to frequent page swaps between physical memory and disk, thereby exacerbating performance issues characteristic of thrashing in legacy systems.

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○

- **System Memory Monitoring:** Monitor physical memory usage, swap usage, and available memory
- **Page Fault Analysis:** Track page fault rates and types (minor vs major faults)
- **Disk I/O Monitoring:** Analyze disk I/O patterns to identify paging-related activity
- **Working Set Analysis:** Measure application working set sizes relative to available memory
- **Performance Profiling:** Profile applications during memory pressure to identify thrashing patterns
- **Virtual Memory Statistics:** Monitor virtual memory system statistics and swap file activity


## Examples

A database server with 8GB of RAM attempts to process a dataset requiring 12GB of memory. As queries access different parts of the dataset, the operating system constantly swaps pages between memory and disk. Each database operation that should take milliseconds now takes seconds due to disk access delays, and the system spends 90% of its time on memory management rather than query processing. Another example involves a batch processing system that spawns multiple worker processes, each loading large data files into memory. When the combined memory usage exceeds available RAM, the system begins thrashing as each process's memory gets swapped out while other processes run, creating a cycle where no process can maintain its working set in memory long enough to complete efficiently.
