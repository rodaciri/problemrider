## Description

Work queue buildup occurs when tasks accumulate faster than they can be processed, creating queues that delay completion and reduce overall system throughput. This commonly happens at bottleneck points in the development process, such as code reviews, testing phases, deployment approvals, or when specific expertise is required. Queue buildup indicates that demand exceeds capacity at critical process steps.

## Indicators ⟡

- Tasks consistently wait longer in queues than they take to actually complete
- Work items accumulate at specific process steps
- Team members frequently wait for others to complete prerequisite tasks
- Processing time is much shorter than total cycle time
- Queue lengths grow over time rather than remaining stable

## Root Causes ▼

*No significant relationships within the scope of legacy systems identified (yet).*

## Detection Methods ○

- **Queue Length Monitoring:** Track the number of items waiting at each process step over time
- **Cycle Time Analysis:** Measure total time from task start to completion versus actual work time
- **Flow Efficiency Calculation:** Calculate the ratio of work time to total cycle time
- **Bottleneck Identification:** Identify which process steps consistently have the longest queues
- **Throughput Measurement:** Monitor how many tasks are completed per time period at each stage

## Examples

A development team's code review process has become a significant bottleneck, with pull requests waiting an average of 5 days for review while the actual review time is only 30 minutes. The queue of pending reviews grows to 20+ items, forcing developers to context-switch to other tasks while waiting. When urgent fixes need to be deployed, they jump the queue, further delaying other work and creating unpredictable completion times. Another example involves a deployment process where completed features wait in a queue for monthly release windows. The deployment queue grows throughout the month, and by release time, there are dozens of changes to deploy simultaneously, increasing the risk of deployment failures and making it difficult to identify the source of any problems that occur.
